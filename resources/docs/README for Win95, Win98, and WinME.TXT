The following options will NOT work with Windows 95/98/ME, due to the use of a native
Windows transform function that was not added until Windows 2000:

newQuit: on
colorClient: 4

In addition on older, slow computers you may not want to use

planetBitmapGalaxy: 3

as there are more frequent planet redraws on the galactic, and it may cause a 
performance hit.

So in conclusion, don't have any of those above options in your netrekrc, and the client 
should work fine!
