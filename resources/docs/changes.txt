Netrek XP 2006, Version 1.3:

User interface:
1) War window now says "Re-program" instead of "Save" for changing war settings.
2) The planet list window can now be used with info, lock and certain RCDs.  In
other words, you can lock onto planets through the planet list window, and send
planet-related RCDs through the window as well.
3) New Options menus for Hockey and Weapons.
4) Added ability to update buttonmap through the options menu.
5) Restored ability for middle and right mouse clicks to raise the current
window to the top, helps with overlapped windows.
6) Default buttonmap now uses mouse wheel for accel/decel, scroll up to
accelerate to max, scroll down to decelerate to warp 0.
7) Left clicking on message window will either a) start a new message to all
board or b) continue current pending message.
8) Message window will now say "Click here to send a message to ALL" until any
message is sent, then it will be blank as usual.  Mostly to help newbies
figure out how to send a message.
9) Rank window now shows DI needed for next rank.
10) Added the ability to change the size of the local or map windows!  This is a
huge improvement, and is probably the most often requested feature.  There
really is no limit on how big or small you can make the windows.  As you
increase local window size, you can see further, giving somewhat of a gameplay
advantage - you can see ships, shields, explosions, but not weapons fire other
than your own torps.  Just as important, you can now choose a different size for
local vs map window.  A typical user may want a 750x750 local but only a 400x400
map.  The upper pixel limit is 5000x5000 for either map or local window, but I
don't expect anyone has a monitor to support even close to that limit.
11) Most netrekrc window's geometries are now commented out (all except map and
local), this is because adjusting the size of local or map will now do a pretty
good job of autoplacing all the other windows for you.
12) Added new function keys, control-z and control-a, for zooming.  Control-z
zooms in, and control-a zooms out.  As part of the benefit of having all
graphics scale, ALL ship bitmap sets can now show ships to 256 positions.
13) Added richtext message windows, which allow stuff like cut and paste from
within the message windows, and clickable URLs.  Richtext message windows are
both resizeable and moveable.  Moving them works a little different than moving
other windows.  Instead of clicking on the border, you click on the body of the
window, hold down left mouse button, and move the window.  This only works if
the richTextMove option is on.
14) The mainResizeable netrekrc option now allows map/local to be resizeable.
Note that resizing local and map windows only lets you size them as squares.
Some windows (team select, quit) will resize properly to match new local size,
others (position of options menu, dashboard, etc.) will not move.  Interesting
sidenote: resizing local window will reinitialize background star positions.
To resize the local/map/richtext windows, right click on window border to
activate sizing border, resize the window as you want, then right click again
to deactivate sizing border. The reason the procedure is a little complicated is
because having a border which can resize the window requires a larger border,
which cuts into precious screen space.  So this sizing border needs to be
activated first, then deactivated when the window is done sizing.
15) The ' key (single quote) is now the default key for toggling on and off the
expanded playerlist window.
16) Color settings are now all listed in netrekrc, and a list of valid colors is
now found at the end of the netrekxp manual.
17) You now get a popup box when client receives a game shutdown message from
server, indicating that the game has been terminated and to try again later.
18) Main title bar now defaults to on.
19) Can now change login name via options menu (don't forget to save if you want
to make it permanent).
20) The left and right arrow keys are now mapped to turn left and turn right,
they execute a turn request for a 1/16 turn in the desired direction.  I
personally find it awkward but if someone is playing without a mouse for
whatever reason, it allows them to move at least.  Since using the arrow pad
requires a keyboard equivalent key, and these are new keyactions, there are now
2 less available key sequences.  Control+[ is now mapped to turn left, and
control+] is turn right, these keys were selected to be as out of the way as
possible to avoid conflicts with existing keymaps.  Turn keys are controlled
server side via the TURN_KEYS feature packet, so they will only work if the
server allows it.
21) The up and down arrow keys now are mapped to accelerate and deccelerate.
22) The console window is now on by default.  To hide it, use the -n option,
which was previously used to turn console window on (it now turns it off).
23) Cambot playback, cambot record, and console window symbolic links are no
longer included in the distribution.  Cambot is most easily played/recorded
with the cambot utility, and console window is now default to on.

Graphics:
1) New graphics for the team select windows, and new option
"newTeams: (on)/off" whether to use these graphics or the old team windows.
2) Fixed flicker experienced sometimes seen with stationary ships near a planet
on the galactic map.
3) The old mono torps are now default.  Big torps are nice and all, but I think
there is a loss in dodging ability with the bigger torps.

Sound:
1) Added new sounds for when engine melt, and then for when they are unmelted.
2) Sound can now be initialized via sound menu if program starts with sound off.
3) Start music will no longer play if you connect to a server and wind up on a
wait queue, the music will instead play once you reach the login screen.
  
General bug fixes:
1) Fixed bug with metaserver not sorting correctly sometimes, and some server
entries not having their metaping field initialized.
2) Fixed bug where alert border was not working right upon death with old ship
bitmaps.
3) Fixed error messages with cambot and beeplite.
4) Fixed music playback with cambot so it stops playing on entry properly.
5) Several fixes to BRMH shrink phasers - they now can shrink on miss, and
enemy phasers also shrink properly.
6) Planet window no longer gets unmapped on death.
7) Fixed macro crash bug with sending macros to invisible players on the
playerlist.
8) Fixed annoying bug where tactical would sometimes seem to disappear on
reentry into game after death, was due to losing your position packet and not
requesting a new one (you now WILL request a position update if alive but
seemingly off the map).
9) Fixed bug with self phasers where they would sometimes stretch across the
screen upon death.
10) Dist.taking (used in older netrekrc files) will now work, though dist.take
is still the preferred name for that distress call.
11) Changed how message HUD works, it now is refreshed during the redraw of the
local map rather than updated independently, should fix some redraw bugs with
message HUD.
12) Enemy torps which are off local screen are no longer automatically freed
(since this data is now sent for observers).  Also fixed an issue with exploding
torps that would not clear properly.
13) Fixed a bug with RCM kill messages when kills were higher than 255 but less
than 320.
14) Bomb RCD used on an unknown planet or planet with 4 or less armies will now
say "bomb <planetname>" instead of the more useless, unspecific "bomb".
15) Fixed galactic and tactical planet names so they are centered on planets.
16) Phaser misses on sturgeon servers now show proper phaser length based on
how many phaser upgrades the ship has.
17) Certain abnormal game terminations (such as caused by a server exiting
the daemon) will no longer crash the client, instead client will just exit.
This fixes the last known "crash bug".  There still may exist times when the
client is seen to freeze, such as upon ghostbust or slot being freed in INL,
as the client hopes to re-establish a connection and thus doesn't exit.

New features:
1) Main window titlebar now shows your loginname and slot number, in addition
to showing the servername.
2) New dashboard message for warp 0 ("Stopped") instead of saying "Impulse"
3) Added "autoSetWar: (0-2)" netrekrc option that controls declare war settings
with enemy races when you first join.  Can now automatically declare peace on
3rd space races, for example.
4) Improved explanation of keymap/buttonmap in the netrekrc.
5) Support for AT ship in playerlist and info window (shows 'AT' instead of
'??').
6) The "Flags" text on COW and KRP dashboards will now turn red if your ship is
weapon temped or engine temped.
7) Added "lockLine: (on)/off" to draw a dashed green line on the galactic map
between your ship and the target you are locked on to, whether it be a player or
a planet.
8) Added "tractorID: (on)/off" to draw the player number of the person you are
tractoring or pressoring below and to the left of your ship.  Continues to
display who you are tractor/pressoring even if they cloak.
9) Added "puckArrow: (on)/off" option to draw a tic mark on the puck in hockey
to indicate puck direction.
10) Added "sortPlanets: (on)/off" to sort the planet list, with your planets
first, then the planets of the other teams, starting with the team with the most
players.  Within a team, planets are sorted from low to high army count. Left
clicking the planet list window will toggle between a sorted and unsorted planet
list, right clicking will close the planet window.  Team's starting planets are
separated by a white line.
11) Added "headingTic: on/(off)" to draw a tick mark indicating your ship's
heading, as well as a smaller secondary mark indicating where you are turning
to, or in the case of when you are locked on to a player/planet, indicating the
direction to that player/planet.  This option helps with aiming in hockey and
hitting cloaked ships you are locked on to.
12) Added "weaponsOnMap: (on)/off" to show torps, plasmas and phasers on the
galactic map.
13) Removed the netrek.w32caption option that was undocumented and has since
been replaced by the mainTitleBar option.
14) Added "viewRange: (0-3)" option to draw a dashed circle on the map showing
the range at which enemies can see you.  You can choose to draw it at all times,
only when you are cloaked, only when carrying, or not at all.  If orbitting a
foreign planet, no circle is drawn, as you are visible to all.  View range is
disabled if your ship is a starbase.  Cloaked view range will also show on the
tactical map if tactical is resized large enough.  Showing view range circles on
the galactic map is controlled server side via the SHOW_VISIBILITY_RANGE feature
packet, so this option will only work for the most part if the server allows it.
15) Added support for feature packet FULL_WEAPON_RESOLUTION, this means that
observers can see all weapons on the galaxy map, yay!  It also means you can see
your torps on the galaxy map beyond your tactical range (good for plinking).
Can turn this feature packet on/off with the netrekrc option
"useFullWeapInfo: (on)/off".
16) Added "clickDelay: (0-50)" to allow for a delay between continuous mouse
clicks, range is in # of updates.
17) Added "packetLights: (on)/off" to show packets sent and received via
blinking lights on dashboard.
18) New netrekrc option "showCloakers: (on)/off" to show other cloakers on
tactical, only works if server has the new feature packet SHOW_CLOAKERS on.
19) New netrekrc option "showOtherSpeed: (on)/off" to show speed next to other
players, only works if server has the new feature packet SHOW_OTHER_SPEED on.
20) Changed showArmy option to be a range (0-3), to take advantage of new server
feature packet SHOW_ARMY_COUNT.  Range of values is now as follows:
# 0 - don't show army counts
# 1 - show army counts on local map only (default)
# 2 - show army counts on galactic map only
# 3 - show army counts on both maps
21) Added support for CHECK_PLANETS feature packet, this is a nice packet that
checks with the server to make sure your planet info is up to date, so no more
phantom armies on a planet or delay on bombing a planet flat because you lost a
planet packet.  Also no more wondering if you missed a planet packet while
dropping if planet army count doesn't go down.  This cross-check with server
occurs 10 times/second for a planet you are orbitting (critical), and will cycle
through the rest of the planets at a rate of 1 planet every 100 ms.  Adds 100
bytes/sec in upstream data from client to server.
22) New netrekrc option "infoRange: (on)/off" to draw a dashed white box on your
tactical if you increase the tactical size beyond 500 x 500.  This box is drawn
to show the 500 x 500 range, which is important because other people's weapons
data is not sent beyond this range (box essentially shows limit of fog of war
for weapons).
23) Added netrekrc option "richText: (on)/off" to allow stuff like cut/paste
from message windows and clickable URLs.  Richtext windows also have a smarter
scrollback mechanism.  If the mouse is over a richtext message window AND
message position isn't already at the bottom of the window, it will not scroll
upon receiving a new message, as it is likely you are scrolling back to read
old messages.  If mouse is not in a window that receives a message, that window
will scroll to the bottom, solving the problem of sometimes accidentally not
resetting window scrollback to bottom and the failing to see new messages as
they come in.
24) Added netrekrc option "scaleFactor: (10-40)" that allows you to zoom in the
tactical map to get more detail!  Turn on those high resolution bitmaps, pump up
your tactical size to 1000x1000 and see the great graphics!  Default scale is 40
(this is the traditional scale used in clients, changing scale to 20 will
effectively double the scale).
25) Added netrekrc option "color.God: <color>" to alter color of God messages.
26) New netrekrc option "fullBitmapRotation: (on)/off" that lets you choose to
draw the old ship bitmaps to 32 positions (off) instead of 256 (on).  Useful
for those with custom bitmap sets, as it will use all 32 bitmaps in a set rather
than just rotating the first one in the set.
27) New netrekrc option "saveFile: name" to control what filename you write to
when you save your options in game (either with " key or via the save menu).
Default is now netrekrc, so that means if you save in-game, it will overwrite
your netrekrc with your current settings (I have a feeling the benefits of this
strongly outweigh the negatives such as mistakenly remapping things then
mistakenly saving your netrekrc).  The netrekrc save feature now saves
EVERYTHING.  Well pretty much everything.  All netrekrc options, windows
geometries and locations, keymap, buttonmap, macros, etc.  It also saves some
obscure options like ckeymaps, ship specific keymaps/ckeymap/buttonmaps
/netrekrc, b1keymap - b5keymap, and observer/servertype specific options.
Saving servernick options is not supported, but I doubt anyone uses those to
begin with.  If any features are found which do NOT save properly, please send
in a bug report.  In the case of the main window, it won't save the new size or
coordinates if you resize them in game, as this is complicated to do due to
things like task bars, title bars, and window resize borders.  Hopefully
between using the mainTitleBar and mainMaximized options, as well as adjusting
your netrekrc line "netrek.geometry", you can easily size the netrek window to
be what you want it to be.  The in-game save key takes a lot of the pain out of
setting up windows (you should be able to do it without having to edit netrekrc).
It also makes editting the netrekrc to change options mostly unnecessary.
28) Cambot files names are now autogenerated, similiar to logfile names, if no
name is given (names will be like 20070401.pkt).
29) New netrekrc option "mainMaximized: (on)/off" to make main window maximized
on client start.
30) New netrekrc option "richTextMove: on/(off)" to allow rich text message
windows to be moved.  Since left mouse is used to move window, and left mouse is
also used to highlight text, this option defaults to off, to make it easier to
highlight text.
31) Added fontSize option to netrekrc (this option always existed, but was
undocumented and horribly buggy).  This option controls the pixel height of the
font used in game.  As a result of changing font size, most windows should
adjust to a new proper size.  Such as dashboards and playerlist and message
windows.
32) Added support for SP_FLAGS_ALL feature packet, this is a packet that sends
important flags (cloak/shields/alive) on all players every update, if you are
using long packets for players, or if you are using the
FULL_DIRECTION_RESOLUTION feature packet.  This solves a problem with packet
loss using the aforementioned full direction resolution feature.
33) New netrekrc options "useCheckPlanets: (on)/off" and "useGeneric32:
(on)/off" to control whether to use the CHECK_PLANETS or SP_GENERIC_32 feature
packets.
34) Added improved explanation to netrekrc for the bandwidth costs of using the
4 new(ish) feature packets which actually increase bandwidth use.

Netrek XP 2006, Version 1.2: (Released Mar-2007)
- added "messageKeyOnly: (on)/off" so that you will only start messages with the actual
  message key(s) if the cursor is in the message windows.  Previously, pressing any key
  while the cursor was over the message windows/warning window would attempt to send a
  message, which sometimes leads to accidental messaging.
- changes updatesPerSec so it now only cycles over valid ranges as defined by the server.
  For a server running at 10 fps, valid update/sec values are 1 2 5 and 10.  For a server
  running at 50 fps, valid update/sec ranges are 1 2 5 10 25 and 50.
- both sound menu and netrekrc now have ability to turn sounds off by type, i.e. to turn
  all explosion sounds off, all message sounds off, etc.
  The netrekrc option is called "soundExclude", and the valid sound types are:
        e - explosion sounds
        w - weapon sounds
        a - alert sounds
        m - message sounds
        i - info sounds
        c - cloak sounds
        s - shield sounds
        o - other's sounds
  For example, to turn off explosions and alerts, you would have the line
  "soundExclude: wa" in your netrekrc.
- added "soundVolume: #" where the number is the starting sound volume.  Valid range
  is 0-128.
- all "newSound" options have just been renamed "sound".  The old sound playback (newSound
  off) is no longer supported.  Thus the newSound netrekrc option is no longer.
- border refresh now works slightly differently for those using the new color bitmaps
  (colorClient = 4), ships can now be seen along the border edges that were normally
  not drawn, allowing players to get a slightly increased viewable tactical range.
- fixed bug where observers who right-mouse click lose their lock icon
- changed warning message timer to be in tenths of seconds rather than updates/sec
- changed keepInfo netrekrc option from updates to tenths of seconds, so info wins
  remain up at a controllable time regardless of server update rate
- full support for server FPS feature, allowing client to receive up to 50 updates/second!
  In specific, all redraw animations (phaser cycling, torp/plasma spin, torp/plasma det,
  explosions, cloaking, beeplite, warpstreaks, planet rotation) had to be modified so that
  they all properly redraw no matter what update rate the client is running at.
- fixed bug with phaser sounds that were causing others' phasers to play repeatedly
  during the duration of their phaser cycle
- the showArmy option now allows observers to lock onto a planet and see the army count
- the varyShields option now only controls shield graphic, not shield color
- new netrekrc option "varyShieldsColor: (on)/off" which colors shield based on damage,
  and fixes a previous problem where shield color would go straight from green to red.
  Now there is an intermediate yellow state as well.  Damage threshholds are the somewhat
  standard 33%/66% for transition between green-yellow and yellow-red.
- observer support for vary shields, vary shields color, warn shields, shrink phasers and
  colorful (jubilee) phasers
- added "autoRotate: on/(off)" to automatically rotate the galaxy when you enter so that
  your team and largest other team are on the left hand side of the galaxy, if possible.
- added "playerListBlankZeroKills: (on)/off" to choose whether or not to display 0.00 kills
  in the player list.
- fixed cloak/decloak cycling so that it animates properly at 10 updates/second.
- sound and music volume are now independent of Windows sound volume, i.e. changing
  game volume with the in game raise/lower volume keys does not change system WAV volume.
- three new netrekrc options, which are soundEffects, soundMusic, and soundMusicBkgd.
  The first toggles sound effects on/off, the second toggles music on/off, the third plays
  a mix of star trek theme music continually in the background.  Thus, if you wish to play
  with only music, you can.  If you want to play with only sound effects, you can.  Or both.
  Or neither.  Defaults are on for sound effects and music, and off for background music.
- the client can now play music files, 10 star trek themed music files from the various
  star trek series and movies have been added.  Random intro themes will play on client connect,
  and random end credits themes will play on genocide.  These new music files are in the .ogg
  format.
- servers that don't respond to metaping are not saved in the UDPcache, as they are likely
  defunct
- fixed some bugs relating to message windows, most noticeably, messages that are
  printed off the viewable screen will no longer garble scrolling text.  Still doesn't
  work for certain cases, most noticeable if the windows taskbar is covering part
  of a message window
- changed default metaStatusLevel from 3 to 2, so as not to include timed out servers
- new engine sound that replaces the old static-like engine sound, the sound file is still
  not used in normal gameplay though
- changed default beeplite settings to include highlighting and sound effects for
  carrying, take and escorting RCDs.
- sound now fades out over 1 second upon quitting
- support for new server feature packet SP_GENERIC_32.  This is a great upgrade to the server
  as it allows for future data to be sent in this packet (lots of empty room).  Currently
  it sends your ship's repair time..removing the need for the client side repair time
  calculation, which had several flaws and didn't work well with observers.  It also
  sends info on which planet you are orbitting.
- added "UseFullShipInfo: (on)/off" to choose whether to use short or long type packets
  for other player info.  Default is on.  This netrekrc setting controls whether the
  feature packet FULL_DIRECTION_RESOLUTION is used.
- support for new server feature packet FULL_DIRECTION_RESOLUTION.  This is a great change,
  for it now uses long packets instead of short packets for other players ship info.
  This means, finally, other ships can be displayed to 256 directions instead of 16,
  and other player's speeds can be displayed correctly above warp 16.  For those using
  the high res bitmap sets, it is a subtle yet noticeable improvement.  The one downside
  is the player packets are now 12 bytes instead of 4 bytes.  At 10 updates/sec and 10
  players on the screen, it is an extra 800 bytes/sec, or .8 kb/sec, of bandwidth.  If
  you can't afford that bandwidth, you probably have no business being on the internet,
  anyways.  As an added bonus, this feature fixes the problem where the playerlist would
  not update properly - full direction resolution ignores packet size for short packets,
  thus getting around some server code that is causing problems with player list updates.
- planet window now updates regularly when planet status changes
- det circle changed so it only flashes on det, rather than be on all the time
- added "metaVerbose: on/(off)" and "metaUDPCache: (filename)" options to netrekrc
  and help docs, these were part of the UDP metaserver merge
- close windows key now closes ping stats window, graphical ship stats window,
  sound window, xtrekrc window, documentation window, and short packets window
- remapped close special windows key to W (was unused in the prior xp 2006 keymap)
- remapped lower volume key to Z (was unused in the prior xp 2006 keymap)
- help window and hint window are now closeable by shift-right click (assuming shiftedMouse
  is on)
- added "maxScrollLines: (integer)" to control how many lines of scrollback you want,
  range of acceptable values is 50-500
- fixed cambot playback help window size, and fixed bug where you could make the
  the client lock up by using the decrease playback speed button continuously
- added "metaType: (integer)" for which type of metaserver you wish to use, where the
  default is 1, and the options are:
# What type of metaserver to use
# 1 - UDP multiple metaservers
# 2 - cache, then TCP metaserver
# 3 - TCP metaserver, then cache
- merged the COW metaserver code.  There is now a UDP metaserver option, which can be
  refreshed, that merges data from all known metaservers.  The UDP metaserver can also
  solicit other servers as if they were a metaserver, and supports the server option to
  display a comment rather than server name.  There is also support for multicast server
  packets.  This change also renames the old -m option to -M, and changes -m option to
  the UDP metaserver.  As multiple metaservers (and servers) may be polled, it is 
  possible the metaserver window may need to be resized as more metaserver packets are
  received.  Thus the metaserver window may briefly close/reopen in order to resize.
  The time delay on closing/reopening is not even noticeable, from my testing.
- moved position of planet owner on galactic (if showPlanetOwner on) so that it
  does not overlap with the fuel can graphic.  The letter indicating planet owner
  is now in the upper right hand corner of the planet rather than the center right.
- changed how hull damage is colored in the graphical stats window - it now obeys
  the green/yellow/red coloring by percent damage rather than being red at all hull conditions
- fixed dashboard and graphical stats window that were not updating properly when
  a ship cap value had changed, such as buying a hull upgrade in sturgeon
- removed the 'A' key as alternate player list, was causing way too many complaints
  that it was accidentally popping up.  Toggling this window is now controlled only
  through the netrekrc, or the playerlist options menu.
- added sounds for tmode starting and stopping
- fixed longstanding crash bug with macros with more than 80 characters in a line
- added -L option for logging to an automatically generated logfile that is datestamped
  (i.e. 20061002.log will be the log file generated on October 2, 2006).
- added support for multiline macros sent using NEWMACRO variables (%p, %z, etc)


Netrek XP 2006, Version 1.1: (Released 26-Jun-2006)
- middle mouse button now closes the help window
- other people's phasers sounds were not being heard if you were cloaked, this has been fixed
- added "puckCircle: on/(off)" to show the puck's max shot range as a circle around your ship, works
  on hockey servers only.
- client can now tell if a ping-pong plasma is hostile to your ship (no longer assumes your own
  plasma or your team's plasmas are friendly) - the plasma will be drawn different depending
  on if it is hostile to you or not.
- added "mainTitleBar: on/(off)" to choose whether to start game with title bar on.  As always,
  title bar can be toggled by alt+enter.
- changed COW, KRP and text dashboard so they display ATT ship correctly
- changed the way dashboard reports negative values for the bars (hull,shield,fuel,etc) - instead
  of getting a garbled display since most of the dashboards can't handle negative values,
  the number will display as a positive number, but will be in red font.  This effects cases
  such as the KRP dashboard when your ship dies (hull goes to negative).
- fixed ATT maxfuel to match server value
- changed beeplite from built-into-the-client bitmaps to actual windows bitmaps
- added "warnHull: on/(off)" to visually display hull status as a series of dots around your
  ship (same as in COW), except that the colors of the hull dots more closely resemble the 
  corresponding colors for the COW dashboard hull states.  So the hull dots are white when
  ship hull is about 90% or better, then they turn to yellow from about 40-90% hull left, and
  finally they turn red from about 0-40% hull left. 
- fixed case of view box not updating under certain circumstances, like flipping through
  options menus
- changed drawing of the new ship bitmaps to overwrite any other image on the screen, except
  for where the ship source bitmap is black (black treated as transparent).  Logic being that
  ship draws should take precedence over things like planet and planet resource draws, to
  make it easier to see the new ships.
- removed the clock masking bitmap, instead using true transparent drawing
- added a 2nd geno pic, randomly chooses which one to show on a geno.  Also added the geno
  pics for the rarer true genocide case (most of the time game ends by conquer not genocide).
- added 5 new message sounds (can be used with beeplite, or you can just choose your favorite
  and save it over your default message sound file, which is nt_message.wav)
- added enter ship sound to when you refit
- converted 2 messages sounds and intro sound to higher quality to remove unwanted
  static
- changed SDL audio playback from 8 to 16bits, improves sound quality in a few cases.
- added "planetHighlighting: on/(off)" to draw a circle around the galaxy planet in the
  color of the team owner, and a 2nd white circle if planet has more than 4 armies.  Mostly
  useful for new planets to easier tell race owner, and army status at a quick glance.
- changed newQuit from default on to off
- fixed a few bugs in scaled bitmap writing function, has the added bonus of making
  the new planet bitmaps work in Win95/98/ME
- fixed typo in metaserver2 name
- changed the key to pick ATT from X to *, to be consistent with the key for refitting
- fixed bug with lock icon and orbiting
- fixed short packet phaser stats for phaser hits > 1024 damage (only noticeable with ATTs,
  server sends phaser hit packet as long packet instead)
- fixed beeplite TTS with detcircle and doublebuffering, at the same time rewriting the
  text messaging code to display and clear text in a more intelligent fashion
- fixed beeplite sounds with newSound
- hopefully fixed redraw problem with beeplite not refreshing planets on the planet map


Netrek XP 2006, Version 1.0: (Released 01-Jun-2006)
- changed to constant border redraw vs. only redraw border on alert change - fixes some
  problems with the new bitmap sets
- fix to detcircle and shield drawing for observers watching someone who cloaked..it would
  miss a draw during the cloak cycle
- added "rotatePlanets: (on)/off" to use rotating planet graphics, only works with new
  planet bitmaps
- rotating planets!  Well, just the unknown (?) planet for now, lack of art is the holdup,
  it might be awhile till the rest of the planets are done
- fixed tractor/pressors which overlap window border so that they don't overwrite border
- fixed continueTractors option (it wasn't working at all)
- changed default team window size from 8 to 7 lines
- fixed some inconsistencies in how a few RCDs were named - "taking" renamed to "take",
  "generic" renamed to "help", "help3 and help4" renamed to "help1 and help2", and
  "doing3 and doing4" renamed to "doing1 and doing2"
- added "saveWindow: (on)/off" and "saveBeeplite: (on)/off" to allow saving of window placments
  and beeplite macros to the netrek.sav file.
- save options now can save windows placements, review window .allow settings, and beeplite 
  macros
- changed some default window sizes/locations that were either too small (i.e. help window)
  or in a bad spot (i.e. planet window)
- cambot works now with double buffering, and added cambot howto to the NetrekXP manual
- team select screen no longer uses 99% cpu power
- planet kill messages now show armies dooshed (if any)
- fixed colorful phasers to work as intended (cycle through 4 colors and then your team color).
  This feature hasn't worked right since netrek moved to 10 updates/sec.
- added a better default netrekrc file (my personal file), which has a better keymap (designed
  by Niclas Fredriksson), window placements, and macros than your average rc :).  Plus it has
  all the settable rc options listed.  The format of the netrekrc is nearly identical to
  that of the netrek.sav file that can be generated in game from the options menu.  Currently
  the only difference between the two is custom observer/servernick/servertype settings.
- fixed bug with observers with short packets on which was causing incorrect drawing of local
  map in the case of losing player/planet lock (most noticeable effect was a single background
  star being drawn at all times, instead of the usual blank local).
- fixed phaser stats reporting for long packets
- fixed longstanding bug with UDP where display was redrawn too frequently (once for udp redraw,
  and again anytime a TCP packet was sent, like with warning messages).
- observer support for show speed on tactical
- added "showArmy: (on)/off" to show army count of planet you are orbiting.  Can be changed
  in game via planets menu.
- added "detCircle: on/(off)" to show det circle on tactical.  Can be changed in game via
  ship menu.
- pushing transwarp key will automatically lock you onto your team's base, and send the practice
  robot request that starts transwarp, if your team has a base, and if you aren't locked onto
  any player already.  For games with multiple bases on the same team (i.e. chaos), you will
  have to lock onto the base of your choice, otherwise it will send you to the first base on
  your team's player list.  
- added observer support to show repair/declare war flags on dashboard.  Observers can also
  now change lock if they are observing a transwarper (server side fix, but good to know).
- readded the ability to see tractor/pressors if they go off screen (such as in the case of 
  ATT tractors). 
- added "doubleBuffering: (on)/off" to control whether to draw with double buffering (it's
  recommended you do so if using the new planet and ship bitmaps).  Can be changed in game
  through the options menu.
- fixed the -c (report players on server) option so it doesn't crash the client
- readded the ability to autologin by using -C name -A password.  No more extra typing :).
- fixed a whole bunch of startup options (-C, -A, -h, -g, etc) that were crashing client if
  not entered properly.  Also made it so it prints out option list on a misused option.
- added timer/clock back to text dashboard
- added torp count to LAB dashboard
- added new status line to KRP, COW and LAB dashboard. In order of priority, it shows the following:
  1) time left in declare war delay
  2) time left in refit delay
  3) time left to fully repair (if you are at warp 0 in repair mode)
  4) time left in grace period after T mode drops to still take planets (15 second timer)
  5) whether you are in transwarp
  6) whether you are under impulse power (default)
- new netrekrc option, "newQuit (on/off)", to use new quit window
- new netrekrc option, "planetBitmapGalaxy: (0-3)", same options as planetBitmap, but now you have
  the choice to change map display planets too!  And have map and local planets use different
  bitmap sets.  Can be changed via planets menu.
- fixed bug where map window border wasn't being redrawn on death
- shortpackets is now "on" by default.  There are some problems with short packets, such as
  only reporting ship heading to 16 positions, whereas all bitmap sets in this client use
  32 positions, or in the case of the new highres bitmaps, 256 positions.  Some other minor
  quibbles with short packets on is that observers do not get geno messages, and
  shield/cloak status for warp 0 players are not sent by short packets.  However, short
  packets allows client side customization of how data is displayed, as well as reducing
  bandwith, so it is the default.  Hopefully these will be fixed server side in the near
  future.
- fix to problem with bottom and right borders in certain windows (like map) getting overwritten
- new planet bitmaps!  Using Defcom's art.  Changeable via planets menu.
- client now recognizes planets that are flagged as "core": this shows up in planet list menu,
  planet info, and core planets also use different bitmaps in the "New Color" bitmap set
- redesigned color1 ori GA so it's not the same pic as base
- added link to genocide.netrek.org newbie manual to replace broken link
- fix to background star jumpiness with short packets off
- fixed a bunch of stray pixels in mono color and tinted GA bitmaps
- fixed some playerlist bugs, and increased playerlist window from 21 to 32 lines
- added pretty geno bitmap (no it's not Kathy Ireland, it's a color galaxy picture)
- Added new plasma_kill sound (Fatality!) for when someone dies to plasma (note the
  sound fires based on kill messages, so if reportKills is off, you won't hear it)
- fixed the reportKills option, it wasn't working, now it does
- Added new value (choice 3) for playerListObserver so that observers appear
  at the bottom of the playerlist.  Options are:
   # What kind of players to list
   # 0 - all (default)
   # 1 - players
   # 2 - observers
   # 3 - players, then observers
- If sortPlayers is off, toggling playerListObserver now properly shows the correct players
  (ie all, in game players only, observers only).  Furthermore, turning player list off
  with the L key (or whatever key you have mapped to toggle player list) will now correctly
  update the options menu to say "Playerlist is off" in the box corresponding to
  playerListObserver options.
- added sound window for SDL so one can toggle sound on/off
- added a special explosion sound just for starbase explosions
- added "colorWeapons: (on)/off" to use color weapon bitmaps for torps and plasmas!  The
  bitmaps are a blend of COW/Ted Turner bitmaps, with some improvements in the area of
  torp/plasma size and color ratio, the addition of a separate color bitmap for your own
  weapons fire, and the addition of separate bitmaps for "friendly" and "enemy" weapons,
  so you can tell who is at peace with you visually by the shading of their weapons.
  This option can be toggled in game from the ships menu.
- improved mono plasma explosion animation bitmaps
- added a new Playerlist menu to the Options Menus, so the other menus are not as
  cluttered, and all playerlist options are now on the same menu page
- added "newSoundAngles: (on)/off" so one can choose to use SDL sound but lose the
  directionality component (sounds will still be toned down in volume with distance, but
  there will be no 3d sound component).  Changeable via sound menu (if using SDL sound).
- made it so cloak sounds don't play at your twarp flash event (happens at warp 15, 31, 46)
- changed self destruct sound so it doesn't sound like enter ship sound
- added 2 new message sounds (they can be called by beeplite)
- add 2 new sounds for enter/exiting transwarp, and observer support for hearing these as
  well
- replaced red alert sound with one less staticy
- fixed up viewbox so map refreshes properly when toggled
- fixed LAB dashboard to properly display armies/kills for observers
- change to warning sounds: changed current "warning" sound to the yellow alert sound, and
  made the red_alert sound file the red alert sound.
- change to plasma_other sounds: uses closest other_plasma for sound location, as there is no
  good way to determine which torp on screen is most recent for sound purposes.
- change to plasma_hit sounds: nothing special other than stereo effect.
- change to phaser sounds: observers now hear phasers!  Also fixed it so observers locked
  onto a player hear self-phaser sounds rather than phaser_other sounds when that player
  fire phasers
- change to shields up/down: observers now hear shields up/down sounds for ship they are
  locked onto.
- change to cloak/uncloak sounds: under old sound (not using newSound), observers now hear
  cloak/uncloak sounds for ship they are locked onto.  For newSound, you now hear
  cloak/uncloak events for all ships on the tactical.
- change to torp_other sounds: uses closest other_torp for sound location, as there is no
  good way to determine which torp on screen is most recent for sound purposes.
- change to torp_explosion sounds: nothing special other than stereo effect.
- change to explosion sounds:  changed it so observers who are locked onto a player who blows
  up hear the self-explosion sound rather than the explosion_other sound.
- added a minimum distance to have the angular/distance modulation of sound effects (so close
  sounds will sound like they are right on top of you)
- added sound reduction with distance and stereo effect based on angle, for sound events
  that occur on the tactical (weapons, explosions, cloaking, etc).  Current list includes
  cloak, uncloak, torp_other, torp_explosion, explosion_other, phaser_other, plasma_other,
  plasma_hit.
- fire_plasma_other sound now works
- added "newSound: (on)/off".  Allows one to choose not to use the new sound system.  Note
  that this option is not settable in game through options menu, only through the .netrekrc
  file.
- SDL implementation - up to 16 sounds can play at once, with sound volume scaling with
  the distance of the sound event from your ship
- continuousMouse and continuousMouseFix now default to "on"
- fixed the mono fed sb bitmaps so they rotate more cleanly
- updated NetrekXP manual (in docs folder), removed old cow manuals
- all greyscale and shaded old color starbase bitmaps now rotate
- the new color fed starbase bitmaps now rotate
- keeppeace default is now "on"
- tidied up the save_options function, fixing some spacing errors, and putting the
  keymap/buttonmap on the top of the list due to its importance.  Also added the
  sounddir option.
- fixed mainResizeable loading/saving (the option that allows you to resize the main
  netrek window) from netrekrc.  Also made "on" the default setting.
- rewrote TTS centering/refresh code so that text is properly centered and clears
  properly when the message expires.  Updated manual to reflect change of tts_pos
  variable to tts_ypos.
- readded beeplite functionality.  Configuration options described in netrekxp manual.
  Basic rc options are useLite: on/off to turn beeplite on and off, and defLite: on/off
  to use the default settings.  The beeplite option is highly configurable, see manual
  for details.  Can also be turned on via the Visual Menu. Default is "on" for both useLite
  and defLite.
- added preventative measures against loading bitmap files that might not exist - if
  bitmaps are missing, it defaults to the mono bitmaps
- cleaned up a lot of dead space sound at the end of sound files, most noticeably, the
  phaser sound
- fixed a bug in the options menu that incorrectly reported whether the phaser window
  was mapped or not
- phasering plasma now has less of an effect on phaser average damage statistics, it
  is counted as your average damage hit, rather than the previous way of counting it
  as a 38 point phaser hit
- added "dynamicBitmap: (on)/off".  Enables dynamic bitmap switching from the options
  menu.  If dynamicBitmap is set to off, only the necessary bitmap files will load into
  memory.
- renumbered the ship bitmap sets for the colorClient option.  Choices are 0=mono,
  1=new color graphics, 2=single color graphics, 3=shaded single color graphics, and
  4 = experimental high res graphics (the new 80x80 bitmaps).  Default setting is still 1.
  Settings 2 and 3 have the bonus effect of turning your ship color to white (similar to COW)
  due to there being a greyscale bitmap library with matching ship designs.
- added a new ship bitmap set (made by Defcom).  These bitmaps are stored in 80x80 pixel
  blocks (rather than 20x20 for all other bitmap sets).  In addition, only 1 bitmap per ship
  is needed rather than 32 for each ship position - the rotation is done on the fly by Windows.
  To take advantage of the high res bitmap set, Windows 2000 or later may be required, due to
  needing a native Windows transform function to have your CPU do the bitmap rotation on
  the fly.  The long term goal is to replace all client bitmaps with higher resolution versions,
  to have the client scale/rotate as necessary, and to increase tactical size so we can
  take advantage of the higher quality bitmap sets.
- added new scaling/rotation function for displaying bitmaps.
- fixed hightlightFriendlyPhaser option to work again: on for white phasers on hits,
  off for flicker between team color and white
- added some more hints to the hint database
- fixed hint messages so they properly loop
- added Maximize button to title bar

Version 4.4.0.4: (changes by stas, added 18-Apr-2006 )
- added "allowWheelActions: (on)/off" to be able to disable wheel in non-scrolling windows
- added new window "player2" that behaves exactly as player list window, but allows to
  select alternate custom layout and could be toggled with 'A' key
- added "playerList2: (string)" option that allows to select different player list layout
  for alternate player list window, by default it will be "n T R N l M K W L r O D d "
- fixed bug that caused main thread to continue in case player died while scrolling
  message window using scrollbar (which forced him close client window and reconnect)
- fixed incorrect behavior of 'windowMove: off' feature. Previously window would snap
  back to wrong place if the main window top-left corner was not (0,0) coordinates
- fixed old conditional macro bug when having first part false would produce '0' as output instead
  of nothing
- fixed couple of scrolling bugs when main window wasn't at (0,0) coordinates
- long lines are now wrapped by words instead of by chars. maximum message length was
  reduced to 4 full message lines (4 * 69 characters)
- message input window will now show Sender->Recipient even when the input line is longer
  than 69 characters
- changed 'Forum' URL on metaserver window to open Google's r.g.n location

Version 4.4.0.3: (Released on 11-Jul-2004)

- added "viewBox: (on)/off" to show tactical boundaries on galaxy
- added "omitTeamLetter: on/(off)" to stop drawing team letter on galaxy
- added "showStars: (on)/off" to have paradise-like background stars
- added "warpStreaks: (on)/off" to draw streaks while warping to starbase and having
  background stars on
- added "disableWinkey: (on)/off" to allow Windows and Context keyboard keys to be disabled
- added "timerType: 0-4" to be able to switch timer like in paradise.
  0 - don't show
  (1) - show current time
  2 - show server time
  3 - show time in ship
  4 - show user-set time
- "\" will now reset timer to 00:00:00 and start counting up
- added "continuousMouseFix: on/(off)" option. If enabled the continuous mouse will follow
  any buttons that are pressed at the same time. For example if you are steering and
  firing at the same time this fix will allow both events to occur. Without the fix the
  behavior was to only allow one button action.
- sound volume can now be changed using keyboard: 
  'v' - decrease volume
  'V' - increase volume
- planet bitmaps can now be switched through options menu
- rearranged option menus. moved all show/hide window options to Windows menu
- added metaserver2.us.netrek.org and metaserver.eu.netrek.org to the default list of
  servers to try to connect to before falling down to metaCache
- changed some defaults to help newbies
- options menu now automatically resizes when switching from one page to another
- messages can now be up to 1024 characters long. to allow server-side compatibility every
  message longer than 69 characters is split to chunks of 69 and sent one-by-one
- planets and players will appear as soon as they enter tactical window bounds. earlier
  the bitmaps were painted only when their center was entering tactical window

Version 4.4.0.2: (Released on 04-Mar-2004)

- repack of 4.4.0.1 with some bug fixes

Version 4.4.0.1:

- most options in rc file can now have four appearances:
     1. option.observer: string (i.e. "keymap.observer: aabbcc")
     2. option.servernick: string (i.e. "keymap.continuum: aabbcc")
        This one will work only if you have "server.servernick: servername" in rc
        (i.e. "server.continuum: continuum.us.netrek.org")
     3. option.servertype: string (i.e. "keymap.bronco: aabbcc")
        This will work if you either connect from metaserver window (then types are taken from metaserver report)
        or if you use option "server.nickname" to map server to nickname and then define "serverType.nickname" to
        be one of "paradise, bronco, chaos, inl, sturgeon, hockey, dogfight" (so you will have two lines is rc:
        "server.pickled: pickled.psychosis.net" and "serverType.pickled: bronco")
     4. option: string (i.e. "keymap: aabbccdd")
  the options are validated in same order (from 1 to 4 where 1 is best match and 4 is worst match)
- added "window.allow" option to message windows (review, review_all, review_team, review_your, review_kill, review_phaser)
  The option lets you set type of messages logged into that window.
  Message types:
	I - individual messages
        T - team messages
        A - all messages
        K - kill messages
        P - phaser messages
  Default settings:
        review.allow: ITAKP
        review_all.allow: A
        review_team.allow: T
        review_your.allow: I
        review_kill.allow: K
        review_phaser.allow: P
- removed "phaserMsg" rc option, because now you can define where to log phaser messages using "window.allow: P"
- changed player list to not show any information on hidden players instead of returning your own info like
  it was before
- player list is now clickable:
     LeftClick - send private message to person that was clicked
     RightClick - send message to own team
     MiddleClick - send message to all
- added "playerListMessaging: on/off" rc option to enable/disable clickable player list (also added to options
  window to be able to do that in-game)
- added "beepOnPrivateMessage: on/off" rc option. If enabled the client will beep when you receive private
  message from somebody that is not yourself or god.
- added "showHockeyScore: on/off" rc option to show hockey score during the game on map
- changed '-n' command line behavior to opposite. Now the client won't show console window by default
  unless you run it with '-n' or you start the program from command line.
- modified help window to show 'Off' for unmapped keys
- now you can remap keys by pointing at the key in the help window and pushing key you want it to be
- xtrekrc.txt and netrekrc.txt are also searched during defaults initialization
- Pig Call will now include binary version number
- 4th and 5th mouse buttons can now be mapped and used (not tested)
  button 4 can be mapped as '4'
  button 5 can be mapped as '5'
- wheel up and down can be mapped in buttonmap now ('6' for wheelup and '7' for wheeldown)
- added average phaser hit to phaser statistics
- added player number to phaser message (Phaser burst hit guest (R0) for 64 points 10:00:01)
- minor fix in message window. it wasn't refreshed when switching out of netrek with Alt-Tab
  and coming back.
- fixed application bitmap that wasn't loaded right. added both big and small bitmaps. So don't panic when
  you don't see ugly Windows default application icon on your taskbar.
- pingStats window didn't have base window as parent, so it could float around. Also removed option
  to display while not logged in.
- swapped between message windows and dashboard/playerlist. dashboard is now below tactical
- added help line to metaserver window. clickable links to favorite netrek internet resources
- fixed minor bug in saveOptions() where first two macro lines of the first macro were not saved
- added help file to the project (netrek.chm)
- binded F1 to open help file if it exists in executable directory
- added "Save options now" menu to options menu

  float numbers. 
  Now it is possible to set "playerlist: nTK1  RNr1 S1d0" in order to see:
  "R0 CA 0.5  Ensign guest 0.8 2.4 95"
  or giving old "playerlist: nTK RNr Sd" will give you:
  "R0 CA 0.50 Ensign guest 0.82 2.43 95.07"
  Current options that can be followed by numbers 0-2 are: KODSrdBPHkVv

24-Jan-2003:

- added playerListHack: on/off option to fix the problem with displaying
  observers/players in the player list window while playing on server with
  old code. If playerListHack is on then every player with letter greater 
  than 'f' will be shown as observer.
  This way you can display only players in the player list.

  tractor/pressor beams of every player in the game. It is server side decision 
  to enable this feature. By default it is enabled only for observers.

- moved all documentation to docs folder
- changed loaddocs() function to strip first two characters of the document line
  if they are ^[b or ^[i. In case these are the first two characters of netrekxp.doc 
  the line will appear in bold for ^[b or in underline for ^[i (^[ character here is
  ascii x1b that represents ESC char)
- added cow.doc, cow.txt, newbie.txt to distribution. As I know these files can be
  distributed freely.
- added sample.xtrekrc (actually some strips from mine xtrekrc).
