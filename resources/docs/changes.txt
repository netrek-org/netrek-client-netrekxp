Netrek XP 2006, Version 1.3:
- dist.taking (used in older netrekrc files) will now work, though dist.take is still
  the preferred name for that distress call
- sound can now be initialized via sound menu if program starts with sound off
- fixed bug with self phasers where they would sometimes stretch across the screen
  upon death.
- added "clickDelay: (0-50)" to allow for a delay between continuous mouse clicks, range
  is in # of updates
- added "packetLights: (on)/off" to show packets sent and received via blinking lights
  on dashboard
- restored ability for middle and right mouse clicks to raise the current window to the
  top, helps with overlapped windows
- removed the netrek.w32caption option that was undocumented and has since been replaced
  by the mainTitleBar option
- some bug fixes related to handling graphics initilization and exit
- added "viewRange: (0-3)" option to draw a dashed circle on the map showing
  the range at which enemies can see you.  You can choose to draw it at all times,
  only when you are cloaked, only when carrying, or not at all.  If orbitting a
  foreign planet, no circle is drawn, as you are visible to all.
- fixed flicker experienced sometimes seen with stationary ships near a planet
  on the galactic map
- the old mono torps are now default.  Big torps are nice and all, but I think
  there is a loss in dodging ability with the bigger torps.
- added support for feature packet FULL_WEAPON_RESOLUTION, this means that observers
  can see all weapons on the galaxy map, yay!  It also means you can see your torps
  on the galaxy map beyond your tactical range (good for plinking).  Can turn this
  feature packet on/off with the netrekrc option "useFullWeapInfo: (on)/off".
- added ability to update buttonmap through the options menu
- added "weaponsOnMap: (on)/off" to show torps, plasmas and phasers on the galactic map.
- new Options menus for Hockey and Weapons
- planet window no longer gets unmapped on death
- fixed macro crash bug with sending macros to invisible players on the playerlist
- added "mapSort: (on)/off" to sort the planet list, with your planets first, then the planets
  of the other teams, starting with the team with the most players.  Within a team, planets
  are sorted from low to high army count.
- the planet list window can now be used with info, lock and certain RCDs.  In other words,
  you can lock onto planets through the planet list window, and send planet-related RCDs
  through the window as well.
- left clicking the planet list window will toggle between a sorted and unsorted planet
  list, right clicking will close the planet window.  Team's starting planets are now
  separated by a white line.
- added "headingTic: (on)/off" to draw a tick mark indicating your ship's heading, as well
  as a smaller secondary mark indicating where you are turning to, or in the case of when
  you are locked on to a player/planet, indicating the direction to that player/planet.
  This option helps with aiming in hockey and hitting cloaked ships you are locked on to.
- added "lockLine: (on)/off" to draw a dashed green line on the galactic map between your
  ship and the target you are locked on to, whether it be a player or a planet.
- added "tractorID: (on)/off" to draw the player number of the person you are tractoring 
  or pressoring below and to the left of your ship.  Continues to display who you are
  tractor/pressoring even if they cloak.
- added "puckArrow: (on)/off" option to draw a tic mark on the puck in hockey to indicate
  puck direction
- several fixes to BRMH shrink phasers - they now can shrink on miss, and enemy phasers
  also shrink properly
- added new sounds for when engine melt, and then for when they are unmelted
- new graphics for the team select windows, and new option "newTeams: (on)/off" whether
  to use these graphics or the old team windows
- the "Flags" text on COW and KRP dashboards will now turn red if your ship is
  weapon temped or engine temped
- support for AT ship in playerlist and info window (shows 'AT' instead of '??')
- improved explanation of keymap/buttonmap in the netrekrc
- main window titlebar now shows your loginname and slot number, in addition to showing
  the servername
- new dashboard message for warp 0 ("Stopped") instead of saying "Impulse"
- war window now says "Re-program" instead of "Save" for changing war settings
- added "autoSetWar: (0-2)" netrekrc option that controls declare war settings with
  enemy races when you first join.  Can now automatically declare peace on 3rd space
  races, for example.
- fixed bug where alert border was not working right upon death with old ship bitmaps
- fixed error messages with cambot and beeplite
- fixed music playback with cambot so it stops playing on entry properly
- fixed bug with metaserver not sorting correcty sometimes, and some server entries not
  having their metaping field initialized.

Netrek XP 2006, Version 1.2: (Released Mar-2007)
- added "messageKeyOnly: (on)/off" so that you will only start messages with the actual
  message key(s) if the cursor is in the message windows.  Previously, pressing any key
  while the cursor was over the message windows/warning window would attempt to send a
  message, which sometimes leads to accidental messaging.
- changes updatesPerSec so it now only cycles over valid ranges as defined by the server.
  For a server running at 10 fps, valid update/sec values are 1 2 5 and 10.  For a server
  running at 50 fps, valid update/sec ranges are 1 2 5 10 25 and 50.
- both sound menu and netrekrc now have ability to turn sounds off by type, i.e. to turn
  all explosion sounds off, all message sounds off, etc.
  The netrekrc option is called "soundExclude", and the valid sound types are:
        e - explosion sounds
        w - weapon sounds
        a - alert sounds
        m - message sounds
        i - info sounds
        c - cloak sounds
        s - shield sounds
        o - other's sounds
  For example, to turn off explosions and alerts, you would have the line
  "soundExclude: wa" in your netrekrc.
- added "soundVolume: #" where the number is the starting sound volume.  Valid range
  is 0-128.
- all "newSound" options have just been renamed "sound".  The old sound playback (newSound
  off) is no longer supported.  Thus the newSound netrekrc option is no longer.
- border refresh now works slightly differently for those using the new color bitmaps
  (colorClient = 4), ships can now be seen along the border edges that were normally
  not drawn, allowing players to get a slightly increased viewable tactical range.
- fixed bug where observers who right-mouse click lose their lock icon
- changed warning message timer to be in tenths of seconds rather than updates/sec
- changed keepInfo netrekrc option from updates to tenths of seconds, so info wins
  remain up at a controllable time regardless of server update rate
- full support for server FPS feature, allowing client to receive up to 50 updates/second!
  In specific, all redraw animations (phaser cycling, torp/plasma spin, torp/plasma det,
  explosions, cloaking, beeplite, warpstreaks, planet rotation) had to be modified so that
  they all properly redraw no matter what update rate the client is running at.
- fixed bug with phaser sounds that were causing others' phasers to play repeatedly
  during the duration of their phaser cycle
- the showArmy option now allows observers to lock onto a planet and see the army count
- the varyShields option now only controls shield graphic, not shield color
- new netrekrc option "varyShieldsColor: (on)/off" which colors shield based on damage,
  and fixes a previous problem where shield color would go straight from green to red.
  Now there is an intermediate yellow state as well.  Damage threshholds are the somewhat
  standard 33%/66% for transition between green-yellow and yellow-red.
- observer support for vary shields, vary shields color, warn shields, shrink phasers and
  colorful (jubilee) phasers
- added "autoRotate: on/(off)" to automatically rotate the galaxy when you enter so that
  your team and largest other team are on the left hand side of the galaxy, if possible.
- added "playerListBlankZeroKills: (on)/off" to choose whether or not to display 0.00 kills
  in the player list.
- fixed cloak/decloak cycling so that it animates properly at 10 updates/second.
- sound and music volume are now independent of Windows sound volume, i.e. changing
  game volume with the in game raise/lower volume keys does not change system WAV volume.
- three new netrekrc options, which are soundEffects, soundMusic, and soundMusicBkgd.
  The first toggles sound effects on/off, the second toggles music on/off, the third plays
  a mix of star trek theme music continually in the background.  Thus, if you wish to play
  with only music, you can.  If you want to play with only sound effects, you can.  Or both.
  Or neither.  Defaults are on for sound effects and music, and off for background music.
- the client can now play music files, 10 star trek themed music files from the various
  star trek series and movies have been added.  Random intro themes will play on client connect,
  and random end credits themes will play on genocide.  These new music files are in the .ogg
  format.
- servers that don't respond to metaping are not saved in the UDPcache, as they are likely
  defunct
- fixed some bugs relating to message windows, most noticeably, messages that are
  printed off the viewable screen will no longer garble scrolling text.  Still doesn't
  work for certain cases, most noticeable if the windows taskbar is covering part
  of a message window
- changed default metaStatusLevel from 3 to 2, so as not to include timed out servers
- new engine sound that replaces the old static-like engine sound, the sound file is still
  not used in normal gameplay though
- changed default beeplite settings to include highlighting and sound effects for
  carrying, take and escorting RCDs.
- sound now fades out over 1 second upon quitting
- support for new server feature packet SP_GENERIC_32.  This is a great upgrade to the server
  as it allows for future data to be sent in this packet (lots of empty room).  Currently
  it sends your ship's repair time..removing the need for the client side repair time
  calculation, which had several flaws and didn't work well with observers.  It also
  sends info on which planet you are orbitting.
- added "UseFullShipInfo: (on)/off" to choose whether to use short or long type packets
  for other player info.  Default is on.  This netrekrc setting controls whether the
  feature packet FULL_DIRECTION_RESOLUTION is used.
- support for new server feature packet FULL_DIRECTION_RESOLUTION.  This is a great change,
  for it now uses long packets instead of short packets for other players ship info.
  This means, finally, other ships can be displayed to 256 directions instead of 16,
  and other player's speeds can be displayed correctly above warp 16.  For those using
  the high res bitmap sets, it is a subtle yet noticeable improvement.  The one downside
  is the player packets are now 12 bytes instead of 4 bytes.  At 10 updates/sec and 10
  players on the screen, it is an extra 800 bytes/sec, or .8 kb/sec, of bandwidth.  If
  you can't afford that bandwidth, you probably have no business being on the internet,
  anyways.  As an added bonus, this feature fixes the problem where the playerlist would
  not update properly - full direction resolution ignores packet size for short packets,
  thus getting around some server code that is causing problems with player list updates.
- planet window now updates regularly when planet status changes
- det circle changed so it only flashes on det, rather than be on all the time
- added "metaVerbose: on/(off)" and "metaUDPCache: (filename)" options to netrekrc
  and help docs, these were part of the UDP metaserver merge
- close windows key now closes ping stats window, graphical ship stats window,
  sound window, xtrekrc window, documentation window, and short packets window
- remapped close special windows key to W (was unused in the prior xp 2006 keymap)
- remapped lower volume key to Z (was unused in the prior xp 2006 keymap)
- help window and hint window are now closeable by shift-right click (assuming shiftedMouse
  is on)
- added "maxScrollLines: (integer)" to control how many lines of scrollback you want,
  range of acceptable values is 50-500
- fixed cambot playback help window size, and fixed bug where you could make the
  the client lock up by using the decrease playback speed button continuously
- added "metaType: (integer)" for which type of metaserver you wish to use, where the
  default is 1, and the options are:
# What type of metaserver to use
# 1 - UDP multiple metaservers
# 2 - cache, then TCP metaserver
# 3 - TCP metaserver, then cache
- merged the COW metaserver code.  There is now a UDP metaserver option, which can be
  refreshed, that merges data from all known metaservers.  The UDP metaserver can also
  solicit other servers as if they were a metaserver, and supports the server option to
  display a comment rather than server name.  There is also support for multicast server
  packets.  This change also renames the old -m option to -M, and changes -m option to
  the UDP metaserver.  As multiple metaservers (and servers) may be polled, it is 
  possible the metaserver window may need to be resized as more metaserver packets are
  received.  Thus the metaserver window may briefly close/reopen in order to resize.
  The time delay on closing/reopening is not even noticeable, from my testing.
- moved position of planet owner on galactic (if showPlanetOwner on) so that it
  does not overlap with the fuel can graphic.  The letter indicating planet owner
  is now in the upper right hand corner of the planet rather than the center right.
- changed how hull damage is colored in the graphical stats window - it now obeys
  the green/yellow/red coloring by percent damage rather than being red at all hull conditions
- fixed dashboard and graphical stats window that were not updating properly when
  a ship cap value had changed, such as buying a hull upgrade in sturgeon
- removed the 'A' key as alternate player list, was causing way too many complaints
  that it was accidentally popping up.  Toggling this window is now controlled only
  through the netrekrc, or the playerlist options menu.
- added sounds for tmode starting and stopping
- fixed longstanding crash bug with macros with more than 80 characters in a line
- added -L option for logging to an automatically generated logfile that is datestamped
  (i.e. 20061002.log will be the log file generated on October 2, 2006).
- added support for multiline macros sent using NEWMACRO variables (%p, %z, etc)

Netrek XP 2006, Version 1.1: (Released 26-Jun-2006)
- middle mouse button now closes the help window
- other people's phasers sounds were not being heard if you were cloaked, this has been fixed
- added "puckCircle: on/(off)" to show the puck's max shot range as a circle around your ship, works
  on hockey servers only.
- client can now tell if a ping-pong plasma is hostile to your ship (no longer assumes your own
  plasma or your team's plasmas are friendly) - the plasma will be drawn different depending
  on if it is hostile to you or not.
- added "mainTitleBar: on/(off)" to choose whether to start game with title bar on.  As always,
  title bar can be toggled by alt+enter.
- changed COW, KRP and text dashboard so they display ATT ship correctly
- changed the way dashboard reports negative values for the bars (hull,shield,fuel,etc) - instead
  of getting a garbled display since most of the dashboards can't handle negative values,
  the number will display as a positive number, but will be in red font.  This effects cases
  such as the KRP dashboard when your ship dies (hull goes to negative).
- fixed ATT maxfuel to match server value
- changed beeplite from built-into-the-client bitmaps to actual windows bitmaps
- added "warnHull: on/(off)" to visually display hull status as a series of dots around your
  ship (same as in COW), except that the colors of the hull dots more closely resemble the 
  corresponding colors for the COW dashboard hull states.  So the hull dots are white when
  ship hull is about 90% or better, then they turn to yellow from about 40-90% hull left, and
  finally they turn red from about 0-40% hull left. 
- fixed case of view box not updating under certain circumstances, like flipping through
  options menus
- changed drawing of the new ship bitmaps to overwrite any other image on the screen, except
  for where the ship source bitmap is black (black treated as transparent).  Logic being that
  ship draws should take precedence over things like planet and planet resource draws, to
  make it easier to see the new ships.
- removed the clock masking bitmap, instead using true transparent drawing
- added a 2nd geno pic, randomly chooses which one to show on a geno.  Also added the geno
  pics for the rarer true genocide case (most of the time game ends by conquer not genocide).
- added 5 new message sounds (can be used with beeplite, or you can just choose your favorite
  and save it over your default message sound file, which is nt_message.wav)
- added enter ship sound to when you refit
- converted 2 messages sounds and intro sound to higher quality to remove unwanted
  static
- changed SDL audio playback from 8 to 16bits, improves sound quality in a few cases.
- added "planetHighlighting: on/(off)" to draw a circle around the galaxy planet in the
  color of the team owner, and a 2nd white circle if planet has more than 4 armies.  Mostly
  useful for new planets to easier tell race owner, and army status at a quick glance.
- changed newQuit from default on to off
- fixed a few bugs in scaled bitmap writing function, has the added bonus of making
  the new planet bitmaps work in Win95/98/ME
- fixed typo in metaserver2 name
- changed the key to pick ATT from X to *, to be consistent with the key for refitting
- fixed bug with lock icon and orbiting
- fixed short packet phaser stats for phaser hits > 1024 damage (only noticeable with ATTs,
  server sends phaser hit packet as long packet instead)
- fixed beeplite TTS with detcircle and doublebuffering, at the same time rewriting the
  text messaging code to display and clear text in a more intelligent fashion
- fixed beeplite sounds with newSound
- hopefully fixed redraw problem with beeplite not refreshing planets on the planet map

Netrek XP 2006, Version 1.0: (Released 01-Jun-2006)
- changed to constant border redraw vs. only redraw border on alert change - fixes some
  problems with the new bitmap sets
- fix to detcircle and shield drawing for observers watching someone who cloaked..it would
  miss a draw during the cloak cycle
- added "rotatePlanets: (on)/off" to use rotating planet graphics, only works with new
  planet bitmaps
- rotating planets!  Well, just the unknown (?) planet for now, lack of art is the holdup,
  it might be awhile till the rest of the planets are done
- fixed tractor/pressors which overlap window border so that they don't overwrite border
- fixed continueTractors option (it wasn't working at all)
- changed default team window size from 8 to 7 lines
- fixed some inconsistencies in how a few RCDs were named - "taking" renamed to "take",
  "generic" renamed to "help", "help3 and help4" renamed to "help1 and help2", and
  "doing3 and doing4" renamed to "doing1 and doing2"
- added "saveWindow: (on)/off" and "saveBeeplite: (on)/off" to allow saving of window placments
  and beeplite macros to the netrek.sav file.
- save options now can save windows placements, review window .allow settings, and beeplite 
  macros
- changed some default window sizes/locations that were either too small (i.e. help window)
  or in a bad spot (i.e. planet window)
- cambot works now with double buffering, and added cambot howto to the NetrekXP manual
- team select screen no longer uses 99% cpu power
- planet kill messages now show armies dooshed (if any)
- fixed colorful phasers to work as intended (cycle through 4 colors and then your team color).
  This feature hasn't worked right since netrek moved to 10 updates/sec.
- added a better default netrekrc file (my personal file), which has a better keymap (designed
  by Niclas Fredriksson), window placements, and macros than your average rc :).  Plus it has
  all the settable rc options listed.  The format of the netrekrc is nearly identical to
  that of the netrek.sav file that can be generated in game from the options menu.  Currently
  the only difference between the two is custom observer/servernick/servertype settings.
- fixed bug with observers with short packets on which was causing incorrect drawing of local
  map in the case of losing player/planet lock (most noticeable effect was a single background
  star being drawn at all times, instead of the usual blank local).
- fixed phaser stats reporting for long packets
- fixed longstanding bug with UDP where display was redrawn too frequently (once for udp redraw,
  and again anytime a TCP packet was sent, like with warning messages).
- observer support for show speed on tactical
- added "showArmy: (on)/off" to show army count of planet you are orbiting.  Can be changed
  in game via planets menu.
- added "detCircle: on/(off)" to show det circle on tactical.  Can be changed in game via
  ship menu.
- pushing transwarp key will automatically lock you onto your team's base, and send the practice
  robot request that starts transwarp, if your team has a base, and if you aren't locked onto
  any player already.  For games with multiple bases on the same team (i.e. chaos), you will
  have to lock onto the base of your choice, otherwise it will send you to the first base on
  your team's player list.  
- added observer support to show repair/declare war flags on dashboard.  Observers can also
  now change lock if they are observing a transwarper (server side fix, but good to know).
- readded the ability to see tractor/pressors if they go off screen (such as in the case of 
  ATT tractors). 
- added "doubleBuffering: (on)/off" to control whether to draw with double buffering (it's
  recommended you do so if using the new planet and ship bitmaps).  Can be changed in game
  through the options menu.
- fixed the -c (report players on server) option so it doesn't crash the client
- readded the ability to autologin by using -C name -A password.  No more extra typing :).
- fixed a whole bunch of startup options (-C, -A, -h, -g, etc) that were crashing client if
  not entered properly.  Also made it so it prints out option list on a misused option.
- added timer/clock back to text dashboard
- added torp count to LAB dashboard
- added new status line to KRP, COW and LAB dashboard. In order of priority, it shows the following:
  1) time left in declare war delay
  2) time left in refit delay
  3) time left to fully repair (if you are at warp 0 in repair mode)
  4) time left in grace period after T mode drops to still take planets (15 second timer)
  5) whether you are in transwarp
  6) whether you are under impulse power (default)
- new netrekrc option, "newQuit (on/off)", to use new quit window
- new netrekrc option, "planetBitmapGalaxy: (0-3)", same options as planetBitmap, but now you have
  the choice to change map display planets too!  And have map and local planets use different
  bitmap sets.  Can be changed via planets menu.
- fixed bug where map window border wasn't being redrawn on death
- shortpackets is now "on" by default.  There are some problems with short packets, such as
  only reporting ship heading to 16 positions, whereas all bitmap sets in this client use
  32 positions, or in the case of the new highres bitmaps, 256 positions.  Some other minor
  quibbles with short packets on is that observers do not get geno messages, and
  shield/cloak status for warp 0 players are not sent by short packets.  However, short
  packets allows client side customization of how data is displayed, as well as reducing
  bandwith, so it is the default.  Hopefully these will be fixed server side in the near
  future.
- fix to problem with bottom and right borders in certain windows (like map) getting overwritten
- new planet bitmaps!  Using Defcom's art.  Changeable via planets menu.
- client now recognizes planets that are flagged as "core": this shows up in planet list menu,
  planet info, and core planets also use different bitmaps in the "New Color" bitmap set
- redesigned color1 ori GA so it's not the same pic as base
- added link to genocide.netrek.org newbie manual to replace broken link
- fix to background star jumpiness with short packets off
- fixed a bunch of stray pixels in mono color and tinted GA bitmaps
- fixed some playerlist bugs, and increased playerlist window from 21 to 32 lines
- added pretty geno bitmap (no it's not Kathy Ireland, it's a color galaxy picture)
- Added new plasma_kill sound (Fatality!) for when someone dies to plasma (note the
  sound fires based on kill messages, so if reportKills is off, you won't hear it)
- fixed the reportKills option, it wasn't working, now it does
- Added new value (choice 3) for playerListObserver so that observers appear
  at the bottom of the playerlist.  Options are:
   # What kind of players to list
   # 0 - all (default)
   # 1 - players
   # 2 - observers
   # 3 - players, then observers
- If sortPlayers is off, toggling playerListObserver now properly shows the correct players
  (ie all, in game players only, observers only).  Furthermore, turning player list off
  with the L key (or whatever key you have mapped to toggle player list) will now correctly
  update the options menu to say "Playerlist is off" in the box corresponding to
  playerListObserver options.
- added sound window for SDL so one can toggle sound on/off
- added a special explosion sound just for starbase explosions
- added "colorWeapons: (on)/off" to use color weapon bitmaps for torps and plasmas!  The
  bitmaps are a blend of COW/Ted Turner bitmaps, with some improvements in the area of
  torp/plasma size and color ratio, the addition of a separate color bitmap for your own
  weapons fire, and the addition of separate bitmaps for "friendly" and "enemy" weapons,
  so you can tell who is at peace with you visually by the shading of their weapons.
  This option can be toggled in game from the ships menu.
- improved mono plasma explosion animation bitmaps
- added a new Playerlist menu to the Options Menus, so the other menus are not as
  cluttered, and all playerlist options are now on the same menu page
- added "newSoundAngles: (on)/off" so one can choose to use SDL sound but lose the
  directionality component (sounds will still be toned down in volume with distance, but
  there will be no 3d sound component).  Changeable via sound menu (if using SDL sound).
- made it so cloak sounds don't play at your twarp flash event (happens at warp 15, 31, 46)
- changed self destruct sound so it doesn't sound like enter ship sound
- added 2 new message sounds (they can be called by beeplite)
- add 2 new sounds for enter/exiting transwarp, and observer support for hearing these as
  well
- replaced red alert sound with one less staticy
- fixed up viewbox so map refreshes properly when toggled
- fixed LAB dashboard to properly display armies/kills for observers
- change to warning sounds: changed current "warning" sound to the yellow alert sound, and
  made the red_alert sound file the red alert sound.
- change to plasma_other sounds: uses closest other_plasma for sound location, as there is no
  good way to determine which torp on screen is most recent for sound purposes.
- change to plasma_hit sounds: nothing special other than stereo effect.
- change to phaser sounds: observers now hear phasers!  Also fixed it so observers locked
  onto a player hear self-phaser sounds rather than phaser_other sounds when that player
  fire phasers
- change to shields up/down: observers now hear shields up/down sounds for ship they are
  locked onto.
- change to cloak/uncloak sounds: under old sound (not using newSound), observers now hear
  cloak/uncloak sounds for ship they are locked onto.  For newSound, you now hear
  cloak/uncloak events for all ships on the tactical.
- change to torp_other sounds: uses closest other_torp for sound location, as there is no
  good way to determine which torp on screen is most recent for sound purposes.
- change to torp_explosion sounds: nothing special other than stereo effect.
- change to explosion sounds:  changed it so observers who are locked onto a player who blows
  up hear the self-explosion sound rather than the explosion_other sound.
- added a minimum distance to have the angular/distance modulation of sound effects (so close
  sounds will sound like they are right on top of you)
- added sound reduction with distance and stereo effect based on angle, for sound events
  that occur on the tactical (weapons, explosions, cloaking, etc).  Current list includes
  cloak, uncloak, torp_other, torp_explosion, explosion_other, phaser_other, plasma_other,
  plasma_hit.
- fire_plasma_other sound now works
- added "newSound: (on)/off".  Allows one to choose not to use the new sound system.  Note
  that this option is not settable in game through options menu, only through the .netrekrc
  file.
- SDL implementation - up to 16 sounds can play at once, with sound volume scaling with
  the distance of the sound event from your ship
- continuousMouse and continuousMouseFix now default to "on"
- fixed the mono fed sb bitmaps so they rotate more cleanly
- updated NetrekXP manual (in docs folder), removed old cow manuals
- all greyscale and shaded old color starbase bitmaps now rotate
- the new color fed starbase bitmaps now rotate
- keeppeace default is now "on"
- tidied up the save_options function, fixing some spacing errors, and putting the
  keymap/buttonmap on the top of the list due to its importance.  Also added the
  sounddir option.
- fixed mainResizeable loading/saving (the option that allows you to resize the main
  netrek window) from netrekrc.  Also made "on" the default setting.
- rewrote TTS centering/refresh code so that text is properly centered and clears
  properly when the message expires.  Updated manual to reflect change of tts_pos
  variable to tts_ypos.
- readded beeplite functionality.  Configuration options described in netrekxp manual.
  Basic rc options are useLite: on/off to turn beeplite on and off, and defLite: on/off
  to use the default settings.  The beeplite option is highly configurable, see manual
  for details.  Can also be turned on via the Visual Menu. Default is "on" for both useLite
  and defLite.
- added preventative measures against loading bitmap files that might not exist - if
  bitmaps are missing, it defaults to the mono bitmaps
- cleaned up a lot of dead space sound at the end of sound files, most noticeably, the
  phaser sound
- fixed a bug in the options menu that incorrectly reported whether the phaser window
  was mapped or not
- phasering plasma now has less of an effect on phaser average damage statistics, it
  is counted as your average damage hit, rather than the previous way of counting it
  as a 38 point phaser hit
- added "dynamicBitmap: (on)/off".  Enables dynamic bitmap switching from the options
  menu.  If dynamicBitmap is set to off, only the necessary bitmap files will load into
  memory.
- renumbered the ship bitmap sets for the colorClient option.  Choices are 0=mono,
  1=new color graphics, 2=single color graphics, 3=shaded single color graphics, and
  4 = experimental high res graphics (the new 80x80 bitmaps).  Default setting is still 1.
  Settings 2 and 3 have the bonus effect of turning your ship color to white (similar to COW)
  due to there being a greyscale bitmap library with matching ship designs.
- added a new ship bitmap set (made by Defcom).  These bitmaps are stored in 80x80 pixel
  blocks (rather than 20x20 for all other bitmap sets).  In addition, only 1 bitmap per ship
  is needed rather than 32 for each ship position - the rotation is done on the fly by Windows.
  To take advantage of the high res bitmap set, Windows 2000 or later may be required, due to
  needing a native Windows transform function to have your CPU do the bitmap rotation on
  the fly.  The long term goal is to replace all client bitmaps with higher resolution versions,
  to have the client scale/rotate as necessary, and to increase tactical size so we can
  take advantage of the higher quality bitmap sets.
- added new scaling/rotation function for displaying bitmaps.
- fixed hightlightFriendlyPhaser option to work again: on for white phasers on hits,
  off for flicker between team color and white
- added some more hints to the hint database
- fixed hint messages so they properly loop
- added Maximize button to title bar

Version 4.4.0.4: (changes by stas, added 18-Apr-2006 )
- added "allowWheelActions: (on)/off" to be able to disable wheel in non-scrolling windows
- added new window "player2" that behaves exactly as player list window, but allows to
  select alternate custom layout and could be toggled with 'A' key
- added "playerList2: (string)" option that allows to select different player list layout
  for alternate player list window, by default it will be "n T R N l M K W L r O D d "
- fixed bug that caused main thread to continue in case player died while scrolling
  message window using scrollbar (which forced him close client window and reconnect)
- fixed incorrect behavior of 'windowMove: off' feature. Previously window would snap
  back to wrong place if the main window top-left corner was not (0,0) coordinates
- fixed old conditional macro bug when having first part false would produce '0' as output instead
  of nothing
- fixed couple of scrolling bugs when main window wasn't at (0,0) coordinates
- long lines are now wrapped by words instead of by chars. maximum message length was
  reduced to 4 full message lines (4 * 69 characters)
- message input window will now show Sender->Recipient even when the input line is longer
  than 69 characters
- changed 'Forum' URL on metaserver window to open Google's r.g.n location

Version 4.4.0.3: (Released on 11-Jul-2004)

- added "viewBox: (on)/off" to show tactical boundaries on galaxy
- added "omitTeamLetter: on/(off)" to stop drawing team letter on galaxy
- added "showStars: (on)/off" to have paradise-like background stars
- added "warpStreaks: (on)/off" to draw streaks while warping to starbase and having
  background stars on
- added "disableWinkey: (on)/off" to allow Windows and Context keyboard keys to be disabled
- added "timerType: 0-4" to be able to switch timer like in paradise.
  0 - don't show
  (1) - show current time
  2 - show server time
  3 - show time in ship
  4 - show user-set time
- "\" will now reset timer to 00:00:00 and start counting up
- added "continuousMouseFix: on/(off)" option. If enabled the continuous mouse will follow
  any buttons that are pressed at the same time. For example if you are steering and
  firing at the same time this fix will allow both events to occur. Without the fix the
  behavior was to only allow one button action.
- sound volume can now be changed using keyboard: 
  'v' - decrease volume
  'V' - increase volume
- planet bitmaps can now be switched through options menu
- rearranged option menus. moved all show/hide window options to Windows menu
- added metaserver2.us.netrek.org and metaserver.eu.netrek.org to the default list of
  servers to try to connect to before falling down to metaCache
- changed some defaults to help newbies
- options menu now automatically resizes when switching from one page to another
- messages can now be up to 1024 characters long. to allow server-side compatibility every
  message longer than 69 characters is split to chunks of 69 and sent one-by-one
- planets and players will appear as soon as they enter tactical window bounds. earlier
  the bitmaps were painted only when their center was entering tactical window

Version 4.4.0.2: (Released on 04-Mar-2004)

- repack of 4.4.0.1 with some bug fixes

Version 4.4.0.1:

- most options in rc file can now have four appearances:
     1. option.observer: string (i.e. "keymap.observer: aabbcc")
     2. option.servernick: string (i.e. "keymap.continuum: aabbcc")
        This one will work only if you have "server.servernick: servername" in rc
        (i.e. "server.continuum: continuum.us.netrek.org")
     3. option.servertype: string (i.e. "keymap.bronco: aabbcc")
        This will work if you either connect from metaserver window (then types are taken from metaserver report)
        or if you use option "server.nickname" to map server to nickname and then define "serverType.nickname" to
        be one of "paradise, bronco, chaos, inl, sturgeon, hockey, dogfight" (so you will have two lines is rc:
        "server.pickled: pickled.psychosis.net" and "serverType.pickled: bronco")
     4. option: string (i.e. "keymap: aabbccdd")
  the options are validated in same order (from 1 to 4 where 1 is best match and 4 is worst match)
- added "window.allow" option to message windows (review, review_all, review_team, review_your, review_kill, review_phaser)
  The option lets you set type of messages logged into that window.
  Message types:
	I - individual messages
        T - team messages
        A - all messages
        K - kill messages
        P - phaser messages
  Default settings:
        review.allow: ITAKP
        review_all.allow: A
        review_team.allow: T
        review_your.allow: I
        review_kill.allow: K
        review_phaser.allow: P
- removed "phaserMsg" rc option, because now you can define where to log phaser messages using "window.allow: P"
- changed player list to not show any information on hidden players instead of returning your own info like
  it was before
- player list is now clickable:
     LeftClick - send private message to person that was clicked
     RightClick - send message to own team
     MiddleClick - send message to all
- added "playerListMessaging: on/off" rc option to enable/disable clickable player list (also added to options
  window to be able to do that in-game)

  message from somebody that is not yourself or god.

- minor fix in message window. it wasn't refreshed when switching out of netrek with Alt-Tab
  and coming back.
- fixed application bitmap that wasn't loaded right. added both big and small bitmaps. So don't panic when
  you don't see ugly Windows default application icon on your taskbar.

  to display while not logged in.
