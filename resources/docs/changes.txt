Version TBA:
- added "colorWeapons: (on)/off" to use color weapon bitmaps for torps and plasmas!  The
  bitmaps are a blend of COW/Ted Turner bitmaps, with some improvements in the area of
  torp/plasma size and color ratio, the addition of a separate color bitmap for your own
  weapons fire, and the addition of separate bitmaps for "friendly" and "enemy" weapons,
  so you can tell who is at peace with you visually by the shading of their weapons.
  This option can be toggled in game from the Ships Menu.
- improved mono plasma explosion animation bitmaps
- added a new Playerlist menu to the Options Menus, so the other menus are not as
  cluttered, and all playerlist options are now on the same menu page.
- added "newSoundAngles: (on)/off" so one can choose to use SDL sound but lose the
  directionality component (sounds will still be toned down in volume with distance, but
  there will be no 3d sound component)
- made it so cloak sounds don't play at your twarp flash event (happens at warp 15, 31, 46)
- changed self destruct sound so it doesn't sound like enter ship sound
- added 2 new message sounds (they can be called by beeplite)
- add 2 new sounds for enter/exiting transwarp, and observer support for hearing these as
  well
- replaced red alert sound with one less staticy
- fixed beeplite observer bug
- fixed up viewbox so map refreshes properly when toggled
- fixed LAB dashboard to properly display armies/kills for observers
- fixed a bunch of compiler warnings
- change to warning sounds: changed current "warning" sound to the yellow alert sound, and
  made the red_alert sound file the red alert sound.  Added additional measures to stop
  playing the alert sound if you go down in alert status
- change to plasma_other sounds: uses closest other_plasma for sound location, as there is no
  good way to determine which torp on screen is most recent for sound purposes.
- change to plasma_hit sounds: nothing special other than stereo effect
- change to phaser sounds: observers now hear phasers!  Also fixed it so observers locked
  onto a player hear self-phaser sounds rather than phaser_other sounds when that player
  fire phasers
- change to shields up/down: observers now hear shields up/down sounds for ship they are
  locked onto.
- change to cloak/uncloak sounds: under old sound (not using newSound), observers now hear
  cloak/uncloak sounds for ship they are locked onto.  For newSound, you now hear
  cloak/uncloak events for all ships on the tactical.
- change to torp_other sounds: uses closest other_torp for sound location, as there is no
  good way to determine which torp on screen is most recent for sound purposes.
- change to torp_explosion sounds: nothing special other than stereo effect.
- change to explosion sounds:  changed it so observers who are locked onto a player who blows
  up hear the self-explosion sound rather than the explosion_other sound.
- added a minimum distance to have the angular/distance modulation of sound effects (so close
  sounds will sound like they are right on top of you).
- added sound reduction with distance and stereo effect based on angle, for sound events
  that occur on the tactical (weapons, explosions, cloaking, etc).  Current list includes
  cloak, uncloak, torp_other, torp_explosion, explosion_other, phaser_other, plasma_other,
  plasma_hit
- fire_plasma_other sound now works
- added "newSound: (on)/off".  Allows one to choose not to use the new sound system.  Note
  that this option is not settable in game through options menu, only through the .netrekrc
  file.
- added Mix_CloseAudio calls when exiting to clean up memory
- initial SDL implementation
- continuousMouse and continuousMouseFix now default to on
- fixed the mono fed sb bitmaps so they rotate more cleanly
- updated NetrekXP manual (in docs folder), removed old cow manuals.
- all greyscale and shaded old color starbase bitmaps now rotate.
- the new color fed starbase bitmaps now rotate.
- Keeppeace default is now "on".
- rewrote find bitmap routine in a smarter way (thanks Quozl)
- fixed bccnetrek.rc to have proper header so icon works
- tidied up the save_options function, fixing some spacing errors, and putting the
  keymap/buttonmap on the top of the list due to its importance.  Also added the
  sounddir option.
- fixed mainResizeable loading from rc/saving.  Also made default setting = on.
- rewrote TTS centering/refresh code so that text is properly centered and clears
  properly when the message expires.  Updated manual to reflect change of tts_pos
  variable to tts_ypos.
- fixed crash bug in save options due to renaming of .sav file from xtrekrc to netrekrc.
- readded beeplite functionality.  Configuration options described in cow manual.
  Basic rc options are useLite: on/off to turn beeplite on and off, and defLite: on/off
  to use the default settings.  The beeplite option is highly configurable, see manual
  for details.  Can also be turned on via "Use RCD highlighting" on the Visual Menu.
  Default is "on" for both useLite and defLite;
- added preventative measures against loading bitmap files that might not exist - if
  bitmaps are missing, it defaults to the mono bitmaps
- if dynamicBitmap is set to off, only the necessary bitmap files will load into
  memory
- cleaned up a lot of dead space sound at the end of sound files, most noticeably, the
  phaser sound
- fixed a bug in the options menu that incorrectly reported whether the phaser window
  was mapped or not
- phasering plasma now has less of an effect on phaser average damage statistics, it
  is counted as your average damage hit, rather than the previous way of counting it
  as a 38 point phaser hit.
- fixed bug with phaser messages going blank due to improper buffering
- added "dynamicBitmap: (on)/off".  Enables dynamic bitmap switching from the options
  menu
- renumbered the ship bitmap sets for the colorClient option.  Choices are 0=mono,
  1=new color graphics, 2=single color graphics, and 3=shaded single color graphics.
  Default setting is still 1.  Settings 2 and 3 have the bonus effect of turning your
  ship color to white (similar to COW) due to there being a greyscale bitmap library
  with matching ship designs.
- fixed hightlightFriendlyPhaser option to work again: on for white phasers on hits,
  off for flicker between team color and white
- added some more hints to the hint database
- fixed hint messages so they properly loop
- added Maximize button to title bar
- added buildexe script for compiling solely the source code and not the bitmaps
- made BCC default compiler and disabled RSA mkkey check (-nt) until I get a valid one

Version 4.4.0.4: (changes by stas, added 18-Apr-2006 )
- added "allowWheelActions: (on)/off" to be able to disable wheel in non-scrolling windows
- added new window "player2" that behaves exactly as player list window, but allows to
  select alternate custom layout and could be toggled with 'A' key
- added "playerList2: (string)" option that allows to select different player list layout
  for alternate player list window, by default it will be "n T R N l M K W L r O D d "
- fixed bug that caused main thread to continue in case player died while scrolling
  message window using scrollbar (which forced him close client window and reconnect)
- fixed incorrect behavior of 'windowMove: off' feature. Previously window would snap
  back to wrong place if the main window top-left corner was not (0,0) coordinates
- long lines are now wrapped by words instead of by chars. Maximum message length was
  reduced to 4 full message lines (4 * 69 characters)
- message input window will now show Sender->Recipient even when the input line is longer
  than 69 characters
- changed 'Forum' URL on metaserver window to open Google's r.g.n location

Version 4.4.0.3: (Released on 11-Jul-2004)

- added "viewBox: (on)/off" to show tactical boundaries on galaxy
- added "omitTeamLetter: on/(off)" to stop drawing team letter on galaxy
- added "showStars: (on)/off" to have paradise-like background stars

  background stars on
- added "disableWinkey: (on)/off" to allow Windows and Context keyboard keys to be disabled
- added "timerType: 0-4" to be able to switch timer like in paradise.
  0 - don't show
  (1) - show current time
  2 - show server time
  3 - show time in ship
  4 - show user-set time
- "\" will now reset timer to 00:00:00 and start counting up
- added "continuousMouseFix: on/(off)" option. If enabled the continuous mouse will follow
  any buttons that are pressed at the same time. For example if you are steering and
  firing at the same time this fix will allow both events to occur. Without the fix the
  behavior was to only allow one button action.
- sound volume can now be changed using keyboard: 
  'v' - decrease volume
  'V' - increase volume
- planet bitmaps can now be switched through options menu
- rearranged option menus. moved all show/hide window options to Windows menu
- added metaserver2.us.netrek.org and metaserver.eu.netrek.org to the default list of
  servers to try to connect to before falling down to metaCache
- changed some defaults to help newbies
- options menu now automatically resizes when switching from one page to another
- messages can now be up to 1024 characters long. to allow server-side compatibility every
  message longer than 69 characters is split to chunks of 69 and sent one-by-one
- planets and players will appear as soon as they enter tactical window bounds. earlier
  the bitmaps were painted only when their center was entering tactical window

Version 4.4.0.2: (Released on 04-Mar-2004)

- repack of 4.4.0.1 with some bug fixes

Version 4.4.0.1:

- most options in rc file can now have four appearances:
     1. option.observer: string (i.e. "keymap.observer: aabbcc")
     2. option.servernick: string (i.e. "keymap.continuum: aabbcc")
        This one will work only if you have "server.servernick: servername" in rc
        (i.e. "server.continuum: continuum.us.netrek.org")
     3. option.servertype: string (i.e. "keymap.bronco: aabbcc")
        This will work if you either connect from metaserver window (then types are taken from metaserver report)
        or if you use option "server.nickname" to map server to nickname and then define "serverType.nickname" to
        be one of "paradise, bronco, chaos, inl, sturgeon, hockey, dogfight" (so you will have two lines is rc:
        "server.pickled: pickled.psychosis.net" and "serverType.pickled: bronco")
     4. option: string (i.e. "keymap: aabbccdd")
  the options are validated in same order (from 1 to 4 where 1 is best match and 4 is worst match)
- added "window.allow" option to message windows (review, review_all, review_team, review_your, review_kill, review_phaser)
  The option lets you set type of messages logged into that window.
  Message types:
	I - individual messages
        T - team messages
        A - all messages
        K - kill messages
        P - phaser messages
  Default settings:
        review.allow: ITAKP
        review_all.allow: A
        review_team.allow: T
        review_your.allow: I
        review_kill.allow: K
        review_phaser.allow: P
- removed "phaserMsg" rc option, because now you can define where to log phaser messages using "window.allow: P"
- changed player list to not show any information on hidden players instead of returning your own info like
  it was before
- player list is now clickable:
     LeftClick - send private message to person that was clicked
     RightClick - send message to own team
     MiddleClick - send message to all
- added "playerListMessaging: on/off" rc option to enable/disable clickable player list (also added to options
  window to be able to do that in-game)

- added average phaser hit to phaser statistics
- added player number to phaser message (Phaser burst hit guest (R0) for 64 points 10:00:01)
- minor fix in message window. it wasn't refreshed when switching out of netrek with Alt-Tab
  and coming back.
- fixed application bitmap that wasn't loaded right. added both big and small bitmaps. So don't panic when
  you don't see ugly Windows default application icon on your taskbar.
