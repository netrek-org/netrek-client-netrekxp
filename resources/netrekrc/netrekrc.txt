# Key mapping
# Define your keymap here.  The format is newkey defaultkey.  For example, the
# default key for shield toggle is 's', if you want to remap shield toggle to
# 'q', you would put 'qs' in your keymap.  Shields would still be mapped to
# 's' as well as now being on 'q'.  Adding a mapping doesn't delete the old
# one.  If you want shields on 'w' as well, put 'ws' in your keymap.  If you
# had instead put 'wq', it would have mapped quit (the default action of 'q')
# onto 'w'.
keymap: PpW Zva%d_eyftg^jmnrpPrls3tfuwvDwsye d

# Mouse button mapping
# Button map lets you map the mouse buttons.  Unfortunately, it works in a
# different way than keymap.  The format is <mousebutton> <key>.  To map
# shields onto button 1 (the left one), you would put '1s' in your keymap.
# The buttonmap works through the keymap, so if you have shields mapped to
# 'q', putting '1q' would make button 1 shields and not quit.  Buttons 4 and
# 5 are support for Microsoft Xbuttons.  If you have a wheel mouse, the up
# wheel is button 6 and the down wheel is button 7.  There is also support
# for shifted, controled, and control-shifted mouse actions, see the netrek
# help file for more details.

# Macros section
# Also '?' can still not be used as a macro key. The following definitions will
# work in a macro (where 'target x' = whatever x the mouse cursor is closest to
# when the macro is sent):
#
#      Standard:
#
#      %a   armies carried by sender
#      %d   sender damage percentage
#      %s   sender shield percentage
#      %f   sender fuel percentage
#      %w   sender wtemp percentage
#      %e   sender etemp percentage
#      %t   team id character of target planet
#      %T   team id character of sender team
#      %c   sender id character
#      %n   armies on target planet
#      %E   1 if etemped, 0 if not
#      %W   1 if wtemped, 0 if not
#      %S   sender two character ship type
#      %p   id character of target player
#      %g   id char of target friendly player
#      %h   id char of target enemy player
#      %P   id character of player nearest sender
#      %G   id char of friendly player nearest sender
#      %H   id char of enemy player nearest sender
#      %l   three character name of target planet
#      %i   sender full player name (16 character max)
#      %u   full name of target player (16 character max)
#      %z   3 letter team id of target planet
#      %b   planet nearest sender
#      %o   three letter team name of sender
#      %k   number of kills sender has
#      %K   number of kills target player has
#      %*   if this is encountered, the macro IS NOT PRINTED
#      %(SPACE)  this is replaced by a space, mainly useful for starting a message
#
#
#      FULLY CAPITALIZED:
#
#      %L   three character name of target planet
#      %I   sender full player name (16 character max)
#      %U   full name of target player (16 character max)
#      %Z   3 letter team id of target planet
#      %B   sender nearest planet
#      %O   three letter team name of sender
#
#      Ping stats: (may differ slightly from server '!' ping stats)
#
#      %v   average ping stat round trip time
#      %V   ping stat round trip standard deviation
#      %y   percent total packet loss as calculated by server formula
#
#      Miscellanous:
#
#      %m   the last message you sent
#      %M   the last message you sent in all caps
#
# As a further extension, a macro may now be sent to any of the following destinations:
#      %i %I %c  send message to self
#      %u %U %p  send message to player nearest mouse
#      %t %z %Z  send message to team of player nearest mouse
#      %g        send message to nearest friendly player to my ship
#      %h        send message to nearest enemy player to my ship
#
#      with a syntax like
#
#      #useful for INL...
#      mac.C.%i: CAPTAIN
#      mac.N.%i: NEWGALAXY
#      mac.S.%i: START
#      mac.T.%i: %Z
#
#      mac.W.%t: SHUT UP, TWINKS!!
#      mac.I.%u: %u: det when you escort!
#      mac.O.%u: (%i) ogging
#
# What this does is allows you to send a macro to a player or team specified by your mouse
# location instead of requiring a 3rd character to be input. Also, it allows you to send
# message to yourself without having to actual sit there and figure out who you are (they
# tried and failed back in the '60s).
#
# Further, tests may be done within the macro system, the syntax for these test is as follows.
#
#      %?   introduces a test
#      =    equivalence
#      >    greater
#      <    less
#
# Expressions are evaluated on a character by character basis until the test is resolved.
# The text of the test is then replaced in the macro by 1 or 0.
#
# Test are then fed to a syntax I call conditional text. The best way to demonstrate
# how this works is example.
#
#      "1%{included if true%!included if false%}"
#
#      This would print:
#
#      "included if true"
#
#      whereas
#
#      "0%{included if true%!included if false%}"
#
#      would print:
#
#      "included if false"
#
# Combining the whole package, a very robust macroing system is quickly generated.
# One can easily design or mimic Distress calls, including the variable NBT
# distress of the BRM client and all the hardcoded message macroing built into my
# own client but never released.
#
# Here are a few more samples to work from:
#
#      mac.F.T:   Help!  Carrying %a!!
#      mac.f:     Help!  Carrying %a!!
#      mac.c.T:   %p++ near %l
#      mac.b.T:   %?%n>4%{bomb %l at %n%!bomb%}
#      mac.d.T:   %E%{%!%W%{%!I'm fine.  How are you? %}%}%E%{ETEMPED!!!  %}
