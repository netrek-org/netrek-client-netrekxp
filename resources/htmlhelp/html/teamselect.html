<h1>Team Selection</h1>
<p>
Right below the MOTD window you have the Team (Race) Selection part:
<p>

<p>
There are four races in Netrek - Federation, Romulan, Klingon and Orion.
<p>
Each of the races has different ship pictures (though the ships have exactly the same
power and weapons among the races).
<p>
In the race selection boxes you will see the number of players playing per race. If there is
T-mode you will only be allowed to join one of the two main playing races. Otherwise you
are allowed to select at least one of three teams.
<p>
In order to select team you should do one of two things:
<ul>
<li>click with the left mouse button on the team box. This will make you join the team in the default ship 
that is defined for your client (cruiser unless you change it)</li>
<li>point with the mouse at the team box and press one of the following keys to select one of the ship
types:
<ul>
<li><b>s</b> - Scout (SC)</li>
<li><b>d</b> - Destroyer (DD)</li>
<li><b>c</b> - Cruiser (CA)</li>
<li><b>b</b> - Battleship (BB)</li>
<li><b>a</b> - Assault (AS)</li>
<li><b>o</b> - Starbase (SB)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
If you want to quit - click on the clock box.
<p>
After death you will be presented the same team selection window. If you want to change your
team or ship you should use the explanation above. However if you want to get back to same team
in the same ship you can push the <b>'spacebar'</b> and you are back.
