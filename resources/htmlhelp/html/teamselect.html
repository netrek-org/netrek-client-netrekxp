There are four races exist in Netrek - Federation, Romulans, Klingons and Orions
<p>
Each of the races has different ship pictures (though the ships have exactly same
power and weapons among the races).

In the races selection you will see number of players playing per-race. If there is
a T-mode you will only be allowed to join one of the two playing races. Otherwise you
are allowed to select at least one of three teams.
