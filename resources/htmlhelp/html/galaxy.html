<h1>Galaxy Window</h1>
<p>
The Galaxy, or Map, window is where you will collect very useful information on
what the hell is happening across the entire map.
<p>
This is a picture of the whole galaxy. All planets have a fixed location
(though there is a server setting that allows the galaxy to rotate). The only resource
that doesn't change from game to game is the planet name, so try to remember the planet
names. This will be very useful.

<p>
Every planet can be owned by one of the four races, or it can be independent.
The ownership of the planet is defined by the armies the planet has. If there are
Romulan armies on it then it is owned by the Romulan Empire. The ownership of the planet
can be changed by dropping your armies on enemy planets. 1 army kills 1 enemy army.
When you kill all enemy armies, the planet becomes not owned by anyone (independent) and thus can
be taken.
<p>
Initially only your team planets are visible (i.e. have resources like fuel/repair/agri
visible when you try to get info on planet). Other planets are grayed out and you can't
get any information on them. In order for a planet to become visibile to your team, one
of your team's players should orbit it.
