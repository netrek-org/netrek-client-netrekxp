<h1>Login Screen</h1>
<p>
After successfull connection to the server you will see the main game window. It is
divided into four parts initially, but we will get familiar with each of them in the
next topic.
<p>
If your client isn't configured to automatically login to the game, you will be
asked to supply your username and password to join the game (or observe the game).
<p>
The login window is located on the top left of the main screen:

<p>
There are two types of logins on most servers - <b>guest user</b> and <b>authenticated user</b>.
<p>
If you type "guest" as your name or push Ctrl-g you will not be required to supply a password. There are
some differences between guest users and authenticated users. The major difference is
that no information is written to the server's player database for guests. So when you
disconnect from the game all your statistics are wiped out.
<p>
For authenticated users everything is saved to the player database, so when you next come
to the server and supply your name and password, you will start the game with statistics
that were saved for you from the last session.
