<h1>Player List</h1>
<p>
The player list window contains information on players in the game. 
<p>

<p>
The window can contain both players and observers, but it can be configured in many ways to fit your choosing.
<p>
Todays servers allow 32 players maximum to exist in game - half playing, half observing. It is easy to tell players from
observers by looking at their player number (letter). Anyone below hexadecimal 'f' (15) will be a player, the others are
observers.
<p>
The list contains useful information on other players, such as their name and login, statistics, hours spent playing, etc.
You will get familiar with all the details after some time of playing.
