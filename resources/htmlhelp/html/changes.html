<h1>Version Changes</h1>
<p>
This section lists chronological changes incorporated into the client.  Versions 4.4.0.4 and earlier were done by Stas Pirogov under the client he called "Netrek XP Mod", as a reference to his modifications of the original NetrekXP which was coded by Steve Sheldon.
<p>

<h2>Version 4.4.0.4:</h2>
<pre>
- added "allowWheelActions: (on)/off" to be able to disable wheel in non-scrolling windows
- added new window "player2" that behaves exactly as player list window, but allows to
  select alternate custom layout and could be toggled with 'A' key
- added "playerList2: (string)" option that allows to select different player list layout
  for alternate player list window, by default it will be "n T R N l M K W L r O D d "
- fixed bug that caused main thread to continue in case player died while scrolling
  message window using scrollbar (which forced him close client window and reconnect)
- fixed incorrect behavior of 'windowMove: off' feature. Previously window would snap
  back to wrong place if the main window top-left corner was not (0,0) coordinates
- long lines are now wrapped by words instead of by chars. Maximum message length was
  reduced to 4 full message lines (4 * 69 characters)
- message input window will now show Sender->Recipient even when the input line is longer
  than 69 characters
- changed 'Forum' URL on metaserver window to open Google's r.g.n location
</pre>

<h2>Version 4.4.0.3: (Released on 11-Jul-2004)</h2>
<pre>
- added "viewBox: (on)/off" to show tactical boundaries on galaxy
- added "omitTeamLetter: on/(off)" to stop drawing team letter on galaxy
- added "showStars: (on)/off" to have paradise-like background stars
- added "warpStreaks: (on)/off" to draw streaks while warping to starbase and having
  background stars on
- added "disableWinkey: (on)/off" to allow Windows and Context keyboard keys to be disabled
- added "timerType: 0-4" to be able to switch timer like in paradise.
  0 - don't show
  (1) - show current time
  2 - show server time
  3 - show time in ship
  4 - show user-set time
- "\" will now reset timer to 00:00:00 and start counting up
- added "continuousMouseFix: on/(off)" option. If enabled the continuous mouse will follow
  any buttons that are pressed at the same time. For example if you are steering and
  firing at the same time this fix will allow both events to occur. Without the fix the
  behavior was to only allow one button action.
- sound volume can now be changed using keyboard: 
  'v' - decrease volume
  'V' - increase volume
- planet bitmaps can now be switched through options menu
- rearranged option menus. moved all show/hide window options to Windows menu

  servers to try to connect to before falling down to metaCache
- changed some defaults to help newbies
- options menu now automatically resizes when switching from one page to another
- messages can now be up to 1024 characters long. to allow server-side compatibility every
  message longer than 69 characters is split to chunks of 69 and sent one-by-one
- planets and players will appear as soon as they enter tactical window bounds. earlier
  the bitmaps were painted only when their center was entering tactical window
</pre>

<h2>Version 4.4.0.2: (Released on 04-Mar-2004)</h2>
<pre>
- repack of 4.4.0.1 with some bug fixes
</pre>

<h2>Version 4.4.0.1:</h2>
<pre>
- most options in rc file can now have four appearances:
     1. option.observer: string (i.e. "keymap.observer: aabbcc")
     2. option.servernick: string (i.e. "keymap.continuum: aabbcc")
        This one will work only if you have "server.servernick: servername" in rc
        (i.e. "server.continuum: continuum.us.netrek.org")
     3. option.servertype: string (i.e. "keymap.bronco: aabbcc")
        This will work if you either connect from metaserver window (then types are taken from metaserver report)
        or if you use option "server.nickname" to map server to nickname and then define "serverType.nickname" to
        be one of "paradise, bronco, chaos, inl, sturgeon, hockey, dogfight" (so you will have two lines is rc:
        "server.pickled: pickled.psychosis.net" and "serverType.pickled: bronco")
     4. option: string (i.e. "keymap: aabbccdd")
  the options are validated in same order (from 1 to 4 where 1 is best match and 4 is worst match)
- added "window.allow" option to message windows (review, review_all, review_team, review_your, review_kill, review_phaser)
  The option lets you set type of messages logged into that window.
  Message types:
	I - individual messages
        T - team messages
        A - all messages
        K - kill messages
        P - phaser messages
  Default settings:
        review.allow: ITAKP
        review_all.allow: A
        review_team.allow: T
        review_your.allow: I
        review_kill.allow: K
        review_phaser.allow: P
- removed "phaserMsg" rc option, because now you can define where to log phaser messages using "window.allow: P"
- changed player list to not show any information on hidden players instead of returning your own info like
  it was before
- player list is now clickable:
     LeftClick - send private message to person that was clicked
     RightClick - send message to own team
     MiddleClick - send message to all
- added "playerListMessaging: on/off" rc option to enable/disable clickable player list (also added to options
  window to be able to do that in-game)
- added "beepOnPrivateMessage: on/off" rc option. If enabled the client will beep when you receive private
  message from somebody that is not yourself or god.
- added "showHockeyScore: on/off" rc option to show hockey score during the game on map
- changed '-n' command line behavior to opposite. Now the client won't show console window by default
  unless you run it with '-n' or you start the program from command line.

- 4th and 5th mouse buttons can now be mapped and used (not tested)
  button 4 can be mapped as '4'
  button 5 can be mapped as '5'
- wheel up and down can be mapped in buttonmap now ('6' for wheelup and '7' for wheeldown)
- added average phaser hit to phaser statistics
- added player number to phaser message (Phaser burst hit guest (R0) for 64 points 10:00:01)
- minor fix in message window. it wasn't refreshed when switching out of netrek with Alt-Tab
  and coming back.
- fixed application bitmap that wasn't loaded right. added both big and small bitmaps. So don't panic when
  you don't see ugly Windows default application icon on your taskbar.
- pingStats window didn't have base window as parent, so it could float around. Also removed option
  to display while not logged in.
- swapped between message windows and dashboard/playerlist. dashboard is now below tactical
- added help line to metaserver window. clickable links to favorite netrek internet resources
- fixed minor bug in saveOptions() where first two macro lines of the first macro were not saved
