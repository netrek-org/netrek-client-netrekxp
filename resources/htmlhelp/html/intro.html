<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
NetrekXP is a client for Netrek, an online multiplayer space combat game.
<bp>
The current version of NetrekXP was originally based on an existing client called COW. Work on the NetrekXP client has been done by Steve Sheldon, Stas Pirogov, and Bill Balcerski. All Netrek clients have some similarities and some
differences. I would recommend trying each and every one of them before
making a decision on what client to play with.
<p>
This help file will let you get familiar with the program and its possible customizations.  Help file originally written by Stas Pirogov, modified by Bill Balcerski.
