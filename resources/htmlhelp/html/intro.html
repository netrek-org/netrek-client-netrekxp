<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
NetrekXP Mod is a client for Netrek - multiplayer battle simulation game.
<bp>
The program is modification of existing client called NetrekXP (yeah, this is
where 'Mod' comes from). All Netrek clients have some similarities and some
differences. I would recommend trying each and every one of them before
making decision on what client to play with.
<p>
This reference will help you to get familiar with the program, its configurations
and possible customizations.
