<h1>Message Windows</h1>
<p>
There are roughly 5 types of messages in Netrek:
<ul>
<li>All - such message is seen by everyone in game</li>
<li>Team - this message is seen only by team (race) that it was sent to</li>
<li>Individual - this message is only see by person it was sent to</li>
<li>Phaser - this message is sent from GOD (server) to player that used phaser. The message contains statistics information on damage</li>
<li>Kill - this message is sent by GOD (server) to everyone. Every message contains data on who was killed by whom, what kind of weapon caused death and how much credits were earned</li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are 6 different windows that can be used to see these messages:
<ul>
<li>Review - any message is seen there</li>
<li>All - only messages to everyone are seen there</li>
<li>Team - only team messages are seen there</li>
<li>Individual - only messages sent to you are seen there</li>
<li>Phaser - phaser messages are see there</li>
<li>Kill - only kill messages are seen there</li>
</ul>
<p>
This is how Review window looks:

The default client setup is to show only Review window, so all messages your client receives are displayed there.
It is common to argue about best message window setups. Most veterans tend to play with only one Review
window. This way they know exact time flow of messages (with multiple windows it is impossible to find out what message
arrived before or after any given one).
