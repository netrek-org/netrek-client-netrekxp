This source tree was tested with MS Visual C++ 6.0 and Borland C Builder 5.5

- Edit build.cmd to set following variables:

RSAKey = path to your RSA-KEY.secret file
Compiler = VCC or BCC (default VCC)
InstCWD = path to folder to copy files to (default \netrek_files)

- Edit clientr.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD
- Edit src\cursors\curslib.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD

After compilation there will be two folders under InstCWD - netrek and tmp
netrek contains ready to distribution netrek client tree
tmp contains temporary compiler files and can be removed

That's pretty all.
