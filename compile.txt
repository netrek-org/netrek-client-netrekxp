This source tree was tested with MS Visual C++ 6.0 and Borland C Builder 5.5

I'd like however to discourage you from using Borland's compiler unless you know how
to debug its binaries. The output is also slower even though speed optimizations
are used.

Step 1:
--------
Edit build.cmd to set following variables:

RSAKey = path to your RSA-KEY.secret file
Compiler = VCC or BCC (default VCC)
InstCWD = path to folder to copy files to (default \netrek_files)
HelpCompiler = path to hhc.exe from Microsoft's HTML Help Workshop (available from microsoft.com)

Step 2:
--------
If you're building with MS Visual C++:

- Edit clientr.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD
- Edit src\cursors\curslib.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD
- Edit src\winkey\winkey.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD

If you're building with Borland C Builder:

Make sure you have configuration set correctly for the builder itself.
Follow setup instructions from builder readme file to create proper configuration
files. Otherwise the compiler and linker won't find the correct paths.

Step 3:
--------
Open command prompt in the source tree directory and run build.cmd

If everything is correct and working then after a couple of minutes you will have compiled
a working client under InstCWD\netrek.
If you were compiling with Visual C++ you will also have a InstCWD\tmp folder containing
lots of objects.  Just delete it.

Step 4:
-------
Get SDL.dll and SDL_mixer.dll from the SDL website (you will need these to run the client,
they must be in the installer package)

Other Notes:
------------
Additional instructions for compiling with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition,
aka Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

You will need the SDK from the web, as the software doesn't come with the necessary files.
Additionally, DirectX SDK is probably needed too, for the SDL support.
Compile the entire project in studio (which includes clientr, curslib, and winkey),
then run the build script from DOS prompt.  I (Bill) have commented out the build lines
that used cscript to compile the source since that command doesn't work with Visual
Studio.

That's pretty much all.
