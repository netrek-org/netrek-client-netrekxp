This source tree was tested with MS Visual C++ 6.0 and Borland C Builder 5.5

- Edit build.cmd to set following variables:

RSAKey = path to your RSA-KEY.secret file
Compiler = VCC or BCC (default BCC)
InstCWD = path to folder to copy files to (default \netrek_files)

- Edit clientr.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD (only if using VCC)
- Edit src\cursors\curslib.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD
  (again only necessary if using VCC)

After compilation there will be one folder under InstCWD - netrek.
Netrek contains the ready to distribute netrek client tree.
