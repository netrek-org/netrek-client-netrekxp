This source tree was tested with MS Visual C++ 6.0 and Borland C Builder 5.5

- Edit build.cmd to set following variables:

RSAKey = path to your RSA-KEY.secret file
Compiler = VCC or BCC (default BCC)
InstCWD = path to folder to copy files to (default \netrek_files)

- Edit clientr.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD (only if using VCC)
- Edit src\cursors\curslib.dsp and change \netrek_files to be same as InstCWD
  (again only necessary if using VCC)
- Get SDL.dll and SDL_mixer.dll from the SDL website (you will need these to
  run the client, they must be in the installer package)
After compilation under BCC, there will be one folder under InstCWD - netrek.
Netrek contains the ready to distribute netrek client tree.
After compilation under VCC, there will be an additional directory called 
tmp which can be deleted.


Additional instructions for compiling with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition,
aka Microsoft Visual Studio 2005

You will need the SDK from the web, as the software doesn't come with the necessary files.
Additionally, DirectX SDK is probably needed too, for the SDL support.  The build file
will not work under Visual Studio.
