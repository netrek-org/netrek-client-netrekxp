CREDITS

Various people over the years have contributed to Netrek, many of their names 
have been forgotten over the years.  It's impossible to name them all here, but 
I shall try.

NetrekXP was derived from COW which lists these individuals as contributing: 
Chris Guthrie, Ed James, Scott Silvey, and Kevin Smith,        Tedd Hadley, Andy 
McFadden, Eric Mehlhaff, J. Mark Noworolski, Nick Trown, Lars Bernhardsson, Sam 
Shen, Rick Weinstein,     Jeff Nelson, Jeff Waller, Robert Kenney, Steve 
Sheldon,    Jonathan Shekter, Dave Gosselin, Heiko Wengler, Neil Cook, Kurt 
Siegl and many others.  (They forgot Kevin Powell, Nathan Doss, Michael Kantner)

Special thanks should be given to Jonathan Shekter for doing the original 
Windows port of COW-lite.

Further thanks should go to Shawn Collenburg for adapting the COW-lite changes 
to COW.

Extra Special Thanks should go to Rony Muliana for the Rabbit Ear bitmaps!  They RULE!

Special thanks for the getname.c ideas that came from Greg Chung.  

Many ideas adapted from COW-lite came from Kevin Powell and Jeff Nelson.

Many of the bitmaps were taken from Paradise version of the Netrek client.  I am 
not sure who to credit for these, but Michael Kellen's name has come up in past 
discussions.  That probably also means Michael McGrath, Brandon Gillepsie and 
others helped, possibly.

Joe Rumsey should be credited, as I'm sure he did something useful at some point. :)

Trent Piepho is given thanks for pointing out some major bugs, giving some 
feedback on the Observer filter(which needs Server support and doesn't seem to 
work, but ohwell) and probably for even contributing some code that nobody knows 
about.
